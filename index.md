## ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Psyllusion" is out ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

For centuries, people have both been bewildered and fascinated by visual illusions. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, visual illusions serve to deepen our understanding of our consciousness and has led to important discoveries about how conscious perception is generated by the brain.

Whereas illusions used to have to be crafted by hand or made using pre-made images not tailored for specific individual needs, with the release of [Psyllusion](https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion), there now exists a systematic way for you to manipulate and generate illusions using a set of parameters (such as using *illusion strength*).

For instance, the famous [MÃ¼ller-Lyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion) illusion below, which causes the observer to perceive the 2 segments of being different lengths depending on the shape of the arrows, was generated using the *Psyllusion* package:

``` python
mullerlyer = pyllusion.MullerLyer(illusion_strength=30)
mullerlyer.to_image()
```

If you would like to try your hand in recreating classic visual illusions or even better, create your own illusions:

To understand more about the parametric approach being implemented in the *Psyllusion* package, we recommend reading our [paper](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2021parametric/makowski2021parametric.pdf), which includes a hands-on example on how *Psyllusion* can be used to generate some classic illusions (such as the [Delbeouf Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delboeuf_illusion) - see below), and demonstrates how *Psyllusion* is able to systematically investigate some important conceptual and methodological issues in illusion science.

``` python
import pyllusion

delboeuf = pyllusion.Delboeuf(illusion_strength=3)
delboeuf.to_image()
```
