      <h2><a href="/publication/lee2021beauty/" >Preprint - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: Evidence from a common mnemonic advantage between aesthetics judgement and self-reference</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          A long-lasting and unresolved debate in the field of aesthetics is whether beauty is inherent to the object of appreciation or to the subject contemplating it. Several studies suggest that physical features (e.g., symmetry, contrast) of an artwork influence aesthetic rating. Nevertheless, this objectivist approach fails to explain the idiosyncratic nature of aesthetic experiences (AE). Recent models propose a multi-process account of AE, integrating a subjective evaluation based on self-referential processing. This proposition seems coherent with neuroimaging studies showing activation of a common neural network during AE and self-reference. Nevertheless, behavioural data supporting this hypothesis is missing. We took advantage of the self-reference effect (SRE) in memory – the mnemonic advantage for material encoded in a self-related mode - to test the hypothesis that aesthetic judgement is based on self-related processes. We predicted that if aesthetic judgement recruits self-referential processing, incidentally encoding artworks in this condition should produce a similar mnemonic advantage as the SRE. To test this hypothesis, 30 participants incidentally encoded 60 painting in three conditions: self-reference, judgement of beauty and judgement of symmetry (control condition). We found that items encoded in the aesthetic judgment condition were as well recognized as those encoded in self-reference condition when participants gave extreme judgements on the beauty scale during encoding. These findings suggest that at least intense AEs activate an individual’s sense of self.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          The recent growth of data science is partly fuelled by the ever-growing amount of data and the joint important developments in statistical modelling, with new and powerful models and frameworks becoming accessible to users. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model summaries and parameters, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information.

          Correlations tests are arguably one of the most commonly used statistical procedures, and are used as a basis in many applications such as exploratory data analysis, structural modelling, data engineering etc. In this context, we present 'correlation', a toolbox for the R language and part of the 'easystats' collection, focused on correlation analysis. Its goal is to be lightweight, easy to use, and allows for the computation of many different kinds of correlations.

      <h2><a href="/publication/blonde2020medio/" >2020 - In Medio Stat Virtus: intermediate levels of mind wandering improve episodic memory encoding in a virtual environment</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Episodic memory encoding is highly influenced by the availability of attentional resources. Mind wandering corresponds to a shift of attention toward task-unrelated thoughts. Few studies, however, have tested this link between memory encoding and mind wandering. The goal of the present work was to systematically investigate the influence of mind wandering during encoding on episodic memory performances in an ecological setting. Fifty-two participants were asked to navigate in a virtual urban environment. During the walk, they encountered different scenes that, unbeknownst to the participants, were target items presented in a subsequent recognition task associated with a Remember–Know–Guess paradigm. Each item triggered, after a random interval, a thought probe assessing current mind wandering. We found a significant linear positive relationship between the ratio of correctly recognized items and the overall mind wandering reported after the task. Moreover, we found a quadratic reversed U-shaped relationship between the probability of giving a ‘Remember’ response and both on-line and mind wandering reported a posteriori. The nearer to the medium value the level of mind wandering was, the higher was the probability to have a recollection-based recognition. Our results indicate that in a complex environment, the highest probability of actually remembering a scene would be when participants present a medium attentional level: neither distracted by inner thoughts nor too focused on the environment. This open attentional state would allow a better global processing of the environment by preventing one’s attention from being captured by internal thoughts or narrowed by an over-focusing on the environment.

      <h2><a href="/publication/girardeau2020impact/" >2020 - The impact of state and dispositional mindfulness on prospective memory: A virtual reality study</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Prospective memory (PM) consists of remembering to perform an action that was previously planned. The recovery and execution of these actions require attentional resources. Mindfulness, as a state or a dispositional trait, has been associated with better attentional abilities while mind wandering is linked with attentional failures. In this study, we investigated the impact of mindfulness on PM. Eighty participants learned 15 cue-action associations. They were, then, asked to recall the actions at certain moments (time-based items) or places (event-based items) during a walk in a virtual town. Before the PM task, participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness or mind wandering (control condition) session. Dispositional mindfulness was measured via the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Although considered as two opposite states, we did not report any difference between the two groups on PM abilities. Nevertheless, the natural tendency to describe one's own sensations (the Describing facet of the FFMQ) predicted time-based performance in both groups. We discuss different hypotheses to explain this finding in light of recent findings on the impact of mind wandering on future oriented cognition. Our main observation is a positive link between the Describing facet and time-based PM performances. We propose that this link could be due to the common association of this mindfulness facets and PM with attentional and interoceptive abilities. Additional studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.

      <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2020structure/" >2020 - The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          While deception is considered as a common phenomenon with important implications, its conceptualization and study as a dispositional trait is under-represented in the literature. Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.

      <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019indices/" >2019 - Indices of Effect Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.

      <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019adaptation/" >2019 - Adaptation and Validation of a Short French Version of the Affective Style Questionnaire</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Emotion regulation (ER) plays an important role in psychological well-being. Therefore, its valid assessment is a crucial step in the investigation of the interindividual differences linked to effective ER. Adapting and validating a French version of the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and test its predictive power in detecting mood disorders. We administered to a large sample (1226 participants) a brief (12 items) French version of the ASQ. We tested convergent validity by investigating its links with mindfulness trait and life satisfaction. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we tested whether ER features could predict the presence of self-reported mood disorders. We demonstrated a good convergent validity by reproducing the original factor structure. We also showed that the adjusting dimension, referring to the ability to flexibly modulate our emotional experience according to contextual demands, was associated with concurrent markers of psychological well-being such as dispositional mindfulness and life satisfaction. Moreover, this strategy was also related to a low probability of subjectively reporting suffering from a mood disorder. Our results highlighted adjusting as an adaptive ER strategy. Practical implications for psychotherapeutic approaches of mood disorders are discussed.

      <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019bayestestr/" >2019 - bayestestR: Describing effects and their uncertainty, existence and significance within the Bayesian framework</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          The Bayesian framework for statistics is quickly gaining in popularity among scientists, for reasons such as reliability and accuracy (particularly in noisy data and small samples), the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge into the analysis, and the intuitive interpretation of results (Andrews & Baguley, 2013; Etz & Vandekerckhove, 2016; Kruschke, 2010; Kruschke, Aguinis, & Joo, 2012; Wagenmakers et al., 2017). Adopting the Bayesian framework is more of a shift in the paradigm than a change in the methodology; all the common statistical procedures (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, etc.) can also be achieved within the Bayesian framework. One of the core difference is that in the frequentist view, the effects are fixed (but unknown) and data are random. On the other hand, instead of having single estimates of the “true effect”, the Bayesian inference process computes the probability of different effects given the observed data, resulting in a distribution of possible values for the parameters, called the posterior distribution. The bayestestR package provides tools to describe these posterior distributions.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model information and data, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information.
