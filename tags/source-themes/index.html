    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019indices/">2019 - Indices of Effect Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019adaptation/">2019 - Adaptation and Validation of a Short French Version of the Affective Style Questionnaire</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Emotion regulation (ER) plays an important role in psychological well-being. Therefore, its valid assessment is a crucial step in the investigation of the interindividual differences linked to effective ER. Adapting and validating a French version of the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and test its predictive power in detecting mood disorders. We administered to a large sample (1226 participants) a brief (12 items) French version of the ASQ. We tested convergent validity by investigating its links with mindfulness trait and life satisfaction. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we tested whether ER features could predict the presence of self-reported mood disorders. We demonstrated a good convergent validity by reproducing the original factor structure. We also showed that the adjusting dimension, referring to the ability to flexibly modulate our emotional experience according to contextual demands, was associated with concurrent markers of psychological well-being such as dispositional mindfulness and life satisfaction. Moreover, this strategy was also related to a low probability of subjectively reporting suffering from a mood disorder. Our results highlighted adjusting as an adaptive ER strategy. Practical implications for psychotherapeutic approaches of mood disorders are discussed.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019bayestestr/">2019 - bayestestR: Describing effects and their uncertainty, existence and significance within the Bayesian framework</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The Bayesian framework for statistics is quickly gaining in popularity among scientists, for reasons such as reliability and accuracy (particularly in noisy data and small samples), the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge into the analysis, and the intuitive interpretation of results (Andrews & Baguley, 2013; Etz & Vandekerckhove, 2016; Kruschke, 2010; Kruschke, Aguinis, & Joo, 2012; Wagenmakers et al., 2017). Adopting the Bayesian framework is more of a shift in the paradigm than a change in the methodology; all the common statistical procedures (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, etc.) can also be achieved within the Bayesian framework. One of the core difference is that in the frequentist view, the effects are fixed (but unknown) and data are random. On the other hand, instead of having single estimates of the “true effect”, the Bayesian inference process computes the probability of different effects given the observed data, resulting in a distribution of possible values for the parameters, called the posterior distribution. The bayestestR package provides tools to describe these posterior distributions.

    <h2><a href="/publication/ludecke2019insight/">2019 - insight: A Unified Interface to Access Information from Model Objects in R</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics. Although there exist some generic functions to obtain model information and data, many package-specific modeling functions do not provide such methods to allow users to access such valuable information.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019heart/">2019 - The heart of cognitive control: Cardiac phase modulates processing speed and inhibition</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Bodily states are heavily intertwined with cognitive processes. A prominent communication channel between bodily signals and brain structures is provided by baroreceptors. Their phasic activity associated with the cardiac phase has been shown to modulate cognitive control in socio‐emotional contexts. However, whether this effect is specific to the affective dimension or impacts general cognitive control processes remains controversial. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of cardiac phase on different facets of cognitive control. We built a nonemotional cognitive control task to delineate mechanisms such as processing speed, response selection, response inhibition, and conflict monitoring. We showed that the systole (after the blood is ejected from the heart), compared to the diastole, was related to faster responses. Moreover, the cardiac phase dynamics also impacted response inhibition, with an increased probability of failure toward the middle of the course of systole. Although the reported effects were small in terms of magnitude, they highlight the influence of bodily states on abstract cognitive processes.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019dispositional/">2019 - Dispositional mindfulness attenuates the emotional attentional blink</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Emotional stimuli have been shown to automatically hijack attention, hindering the detection of forthcoming targets. Mindfulness is defined as a present moment non-judgemental attentional stance that can be cultivated by meditation practices, but that may present interindividual variability in the general population. The mechanisms underlying modification in emotional reactivity linked to mindfulness are still a matter of debate. In particular, it is not clear whether mindfulness is associated with a diminished emotional response, or with faster recovery. We presented participants with target pictures embedded in a rapid visual presentation stream. The targets could be preceded by negative, neutral or scrambled critical distractors. We showed that dispositional mindfulness, in particular the Non-reacting facet, was related to faster disengagement of attention from emotional stimuli. These results could have implications for mood disorders characterised by an exaggerated attentional bias toward emotional stimuli, such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2019phenomenal/">2019 - Phenomenal, bodily and brain correlates of fictional reappraisal as an implicit emotion regulation strategy</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The ability to modulate our emotional experience, depending on our current goal and context, is of critical importance for adaptive behavior. This ability encompasses various emotion regulation strategies, such as fictional reappraisal, at stake whenever one engages in fictional works (e.g., movies, books, video games, virtual environments). Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance. Implications for the neuroscientific study of implicit emotion regulation are discussed.

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2018psycho/">2018 - The psycho Package: an Efficient and Publishing-Oriented Workflow for Psychological Science</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Statistics are a vital aspect of psychological science. Unfortunately, the process of analyzing, formatting and reporting results is often fastidious, time-consuming and prone to errors, resulting in frustration and aversion. On top of that, many available tools for professionals and students are either overpriced, too complex (ie, displaying vast amounts of raw information neither demanded nor needed by the user) or too basic (ie, not supporting advanced statistical procedures). These factors contribute to the reproducibility crisis in psychological science (Chambers et al. 2014, Etz and Vandekerckhove (2016), Szucs and Ioannidis (2016)).

    <h2><a href="/publication/makowski2017being/">2017 - &#34;Being there&#34; and remembering it: Presence improves memory encoding</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Few studies have investigated the link between episodic memory and presence: the feeling of "being there" and reacting to a stimulus as if it were real. We collected data from 244 participants after they had watched the movie Avengers: Age of Ultron. They answered questions about factual (details of the movie) and temporal memory (order of the scenes) about the movie, as well as their emotion experience and their sense of presence during the projection. Both higher emotion experience and sense of presence were related to better factual memory, but not to temporal order memory. Crucially, the link between emotion and factual memory was mediated by the sense of presence. We interpreted the role of presence as an external absorption of the attentional focus toward the stimulus, thus enhancing memory encoding. Our findings could shed light on the cognitive processes underlying memory impairments in psychiatric conditions characterized by an altered sense of reality.

    <h2><a href="/publication/nicolas2017centenaire/">2017 - Centenaire Ribot (première partie). La réception de l’œuvre de Théodule Ribot publiée chez l’éditeur Ladrange (1870-1873)</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Le centenaire de la disparition de Ribot est l’occasion d’apporter la lumière sur l’œuvre de ce fondateur de la psychologie française moderne. Les livres de Ribot seront diffusés chez les plus grands éditeurs français de l’époque. Les auteurs de l’article s’intéressent à la présentation de l’œuvre de jeunesse de Ribot, publiée chez l’éditeur parisien Jean-Baptiste Ladrange. Durant la période 1870-1873, Ribot publiera un premier livre sur la psychologie anglaise (1870), dont l’introduction peut être considérée comme le manifeste fondateur de la nouvelle psychologie française, puis sa thèse de doctorat (1873) sur la question de l’hérédité psychologique, qui porte en germe bien des éléments de son œuvre future.
