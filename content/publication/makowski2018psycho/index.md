abstract: 'Statistics are a vital aspect of psychological science. Unfortunately, the process of analyzing, formatting and reporting results is often fastidious, time-consuming and prone to errors, resulting in frustration and aversion. On top of that, many available tools for professionals and students are either overpriced, too complex (ie, displaying vast amounts of raw information neither demanded nor needed by the user) or too basic (ie, not supporting advanced statistical procedures). These factors contribute to the reproducibility crisis in psychological science (Chambers et al. 2014, Etz and Vandekerckhove (2016), Szucs and Ioannidis (2016)).'
