abstract: "The {datawizard} package for the R programming language (R Core Team, 2021) provides a
lightweight toolbox to assist in key steps involved in any data analysis workflow:(1)
wrangling the raw data to get it in the needed form,(2) applying preprocessing steps and
statistical transformations, and (3) compute statistical summaries of data properties and
distributions. Therefore, it can be a valuable tool for R users and developers looking for a
lightweight option for data preparation."
