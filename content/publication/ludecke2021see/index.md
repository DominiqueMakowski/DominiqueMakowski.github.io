abstract: "The see package is embedded in the easystats ecosystem, a collection of R packages that operate in synergy to provide a consistent and intuitive syntax when working with statistical models in the R programming language (R Core Team, 2021). Most easystats packages return comprehensive numeric summaries of model parameters and performance. The see package complements these numeric summaries with a host of functions and tools to produce a range of publication-ready visualizations for model parameters, predictions, and performance diagnostics. As a core pillar of easystats, the see package helps users to utilize visualization for more informative, communicable, and well-rounded scientific reporting."
