## Introduction



Stoicism teaches the development of self-control as a mean of overcoming emotions, which are seen as a threat to reason and rationality.

"Controlled hallucinations" (Anil Seth), "the Consensus" (Vampire the Masquerade)

Super-stoicism. Or, Aletheism Enkrateia

It has ramifications for personal responsibility.

## The purpose of reality

Anil Seth: the purpose of reality is to survive. Not to be true.



## Masters of Reality


Does it mean that you can entirely control your reality? It's unlikely, example of visual illusions. Objectivity does not disappear, nor physical laws or biological facts.

That being said, masters means acknowledging the existence of the mechanisms and elements biasing our reality.


## About Interpretation

There is no insult in itself, just an interpretation of something as an insult.

Example of same insult to a friend between bros vs. to someone less.

You could argue that the intent is different, in one case it's almost "as a joke", within an understood social game (philosopher that suggested that language is a social mind game), whereas in the other the intent it's to harm the other.

It's possible, but the important element here is not the true intent, but the *perceived* intent. And this, again, boils down to interpretation.

## Emotional Reification

We tend to consider emotional events as more real (cf. my thesis). But that doesn't mean it's real.

Just because you are offended by your interpretation of something doesn't mean it's correct.
