The watch beeped its familiar note, indicating noon. Janus was lying in bed, watching the blue skies through the window.

 and immediately woke up

Approached the window.

On the parking lot there was only one car (black).

A man approaching it. He recognized him immediately,

He rushed out of the door, knocking a man behind, and rushed through the white corridors towards the staircase.



The watch beeped its familiar note, indicating noon.

Soon after, someone knocked on the door. A man entered, and sat down on the chair, near the bed.

- I did it, I did it again! shouted Janus.

- What did you do?

- I travelled in time. I was about to catch this famous murderer, outside, but he was too strong. You have to do something, call the cops... But don't tell them it's me, or they'll take me instead. It's for real!

A shadow of disappointment passed on the man's face, that disappeared almost instantly. He man smiled gently, took out a pen from his shirt's pocket, and started writing down on his notepad.

- No but it's real, Dr Makowski, you have to trust me! I'm not crazy.

The psychologist remained silent. Amidst the sound of his pen scribbling on the paper, one could hear, in the distance, the sound of a car going away.
