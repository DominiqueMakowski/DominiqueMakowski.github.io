### Introduction

### Data

The data comes from the `rtdists` package, corresponding to 17 participants performing a lexical decision task in which they have to decide if a presented string is a word or non-word. 

Two experimental conditions, under **speed** or **accuracy** instructions in different experimental blocks. This data comes with (which provides the PDF, CDF, and RNG for the full 7-parameter diffusion model). 

After removing some extreme RTs, we restrict the analysis to high-frequency words (frequency = high) and the corresponding high-frequency non-words (frequency = nw_high) to reduce estimation time. 

To setup the model we also need a binary (0 and 1) numeric response variable in which 0 corresponds to responses at the lower response boundary and 1 corresponds to responses at the upper boundary.

### Functions

```{r, code = readLines("make_data.R"), eval=FALSE}
```
