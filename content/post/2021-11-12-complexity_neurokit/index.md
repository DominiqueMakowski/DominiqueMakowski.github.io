## NeuroKit2 0.1.5 is out! ðŸŽ‰

In the [latest 0.1.5 release](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/releases/tag/v0.1.5) of ***NeuroKit2***, our team has fixed several bugs in existing functionalities and in particular, overhauled the support for computing **complexity measures** of neurophysiological signals. We added a ton of new indices of **entropy** and **fractal dimensions**, including:

- Petrosian's, Katz's and Sevcik fractal dimension
- Differential, Permutation, Spectral, SVD entropy
- Fisher information
- Hjorth's and Lempel-Ziv's complexity
- Relative Roughness
- Hurst and Lyapunov exponent(s)
- Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (as well as MFDFA)
- ...

You can compute them all using the new `nk.complexity()` function!

```python
import neurokit2 as nk

signal = nk.signal_simulate(frequency=[5, 6], noise=0.5)

results, info = nk.complexity(signal, which="fast")
results
```
```
  DiffEn       FI    Hjorth       KFD  PEn  ...      PFD        RR       SFD
1.536573  0.01524  1.355543  4.720953  1.0  ... 1.017423  1.638357  1.691036
```

To understand more about complexity science, we recommend reading our [preprint](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit), which introduces the theoretical (and mathematical) meanings of complexity and reviews the existing studies of complexity analysis across multiple fields of psychology.

Of course, the [*NeuroKit2* Python package](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) also includes tons of other useful features for physiological signal processing (see this [**quick example**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit#quick-example))!

Don't forget to watch our repo to keep a look out for more complexity functionalities coming up! :eyes:
