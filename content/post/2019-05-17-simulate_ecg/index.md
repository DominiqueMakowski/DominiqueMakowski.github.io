# Create a natural ECG signal

Generating artificial physiological signals can be very useful to build, test your analysis pipeline or develop and validate a new algorithm.

Generating a synthetic, yet realistic, ECG signal in Python can be easily achieved with the `ecg_simulate()` function available in the [**NeuroKit2**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit#quick-example) package.


In the example below, we will generate **8** seconds of ECG, sampled at **200 Hz** (i.e., 200 points per second) - hence the length of the signal will be `8 * 200 = 1600` data points. We can also specify the average heart rate, although note that there will be some natural variability (which is a good thing, because it makes it realistic).


```python
import neurokit2 as nk  # Load the package

simulated_ecg = nk.ecg_simulate(duration=8, sampling_rate=200, heart_rate=80)

nk.signal_plot(simulated_ecg, sampling_rate=200)  # Visualize the signal
```

The simulation is based on the **ECGSYN** algorithm (McSharry et al., 2003).


However, for fast and stable results (as the realistic algorithm naturally generates some variability), one can approximate the QRS complex by a **Daubechies** wavelet. An ECG based on this method can also be obtained in **NeuroKit** by changing the `method` as follows:


```python
simulated_ecg = nk.ecg_simulate(duration=8, sampling_rate=200, method="daubechies")

nk.signal_plot(simulated_ecg, sampling_rate=200)
```

While faster and stable, the generated ECG is far from being realistic.
