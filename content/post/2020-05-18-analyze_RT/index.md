This is a very, very important topic given the widespread usage of reaction times in psychology. Most of the time, we analyze it as a regular variable, using traditional models such as *linear models*, *ANOVAs* etc. The problem is that these models **assume that the RT is normally distributed, which is false**. 

This leads us to adjustements like **outliers removal** or **log-transformation**, distorting the data because of our non-appropriate models.


The good news is, it's very easy to use better models, that account for the non-normal distribution of RT. And these alternatives are beautifully presented by [Jonas K. Lindel√∏v](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/117060) in the guide below:

It is a must-read for all psychologist. Do check-it out!!
