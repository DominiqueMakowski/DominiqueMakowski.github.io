## NeuroKit2 0.2.0 is out! üéâ

What was supposed to be a small release turned out in a massive update. A big thanks - and a warm welcome - to [An Shu](https://github.com/anshu-97) and [Max](https://github.com/Max-ZiLiang), the newest member of the [Reality Bending Team](https://realitybending.github.io/), and thus maintainers of NeuroKit. They worked massively to update *all* of the examples and docstrings. New features include:

- A [**BRAND NEW WEBSITE**](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/) with a revamped documentation, now hopefully much more useful to navigate. Check-it out: https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/ and let us know what you think!!
- An overhaul of the [**Complexity Indices**](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/functions/complexity.html): With more than a 100 indices, NeuroKit is now the most comprehensive package to quantify **chaos**, **entropy** and **fractal dimension** of signals.
- Tons of other improvements and fixes ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Once again, a big thanks to all the [contributors](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for their help in making NeuroKit an awesome open-source software for physiological signal processing!
