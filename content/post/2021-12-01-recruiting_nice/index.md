In the context of a new collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore) and Future Cities Laboratory, [myself](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/) and [Dr Panos Mavros](https://fcl.ethz.ch/people/Module-Lead/PanagiotisMavros.html) are recruiting a Research Assistant in psychology/neuroscience (bachelor/master) to contribute to an exciting new research project that combines a neuroscientific approach to studying the interaction between beauty and the perception of urban spaces.
