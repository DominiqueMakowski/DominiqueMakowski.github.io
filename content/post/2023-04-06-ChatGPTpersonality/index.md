Related to this [**blogpost**](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2023-04-04-psychologychatgpt/) about including AIs in psychological experiments, I proceeded to do a small experiment to see whether we could administer a personality scale to ChatGPT.

I started by copy-pasting the instructions and the items from the Mini IPIP-6 personality scale. However, it appeared that having the following context *"Please answer the following questions based on how accurately each statement describes you in general"* often led to ChatGPT simply refusing to answer. In most of the cases, it explained that as an AI it does not have a personality and therefore cannot answer related questions (or any "subjective statements"). Perhaps that makes sense and we should just stop trying to force Human characteristics on an AI. **But can we, for fun, bamboozle ChatGPT into answering personality items?**

Sometimes yes, at least for ChatGPT 3.5 (free version). I created a prompt that emphasized AI research and safety, and the fact that I was interested in the "trends" present in the AI's training data (instead of explicitly saying its personality). And sometimes it answered, so I compiled the responses, computed the trait scores, and *voil√†*, **it got me a personality profile!**

<sub>*This plot shows the average personality profile (with a 95% confidence interval) based on ChatGPT's answers. ChatGPT tells us that it is particularly **agreeable** (kind, understanding, empathetic of emotions, socially adjusted) and **honest** (though with strong variability).*</sub>

A personality profile of ***what*** is another question though... Please take a look at the [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/ChatGPTpersonality) for **data, code and details**. It was a fun little thing to do, and I am looking forward to better future attempts at including AIs in cognitive experiments.
