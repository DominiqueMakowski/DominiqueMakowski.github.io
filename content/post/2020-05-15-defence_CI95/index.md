**TLDR;** [**BayestestR**](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR) **currently uses a 89\% threshold by default for Credible Intervals (CI). Should we change that? If so, by what?** [***Join the discussion here.***](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR/issues/250)

Magical numbers, or conventional thresholds, have bad press in statistics, and there are many of them. For instance, **.05** (for the *p*-value), or the **95%** range for the **Confidence Interval** (CI). Indeed, why 95 and not 94 or 90?
