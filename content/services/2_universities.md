Your postgrad students (master, PhDs) could benefit from short specialist workshops to complement their set of skills and help them successfully go through through their degree. Typically demanded (by students) training that I can provide involve EEG and physiological **signal processing in Python**, open-source / open-science, programming, **statistics in R** (e.g., Bayesian, mixed models, ...), **experiment design and implementation** with PsychoPy or JsPsych (for online experiments).
