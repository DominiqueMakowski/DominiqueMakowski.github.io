I offer consultation services for academics as personal or group trainings in various technical skills to help **pushing their carrer forward**, increasing their confidence and ability to **approach increasingly more complex problems with best practices**, or helping them better guide and **accompany their students** in their research and analyses.

- **Catch up, get a refresher, or a crash course in R.** R is amazing and will help you gain a deeper understanding of your data and how you can approach it, which in turn will lead to an **explosion of your horizon of possibilities** and the re-energize your research ideas. As someone from a *non-geeky background* (more or less ðŸ¤­), I have developed a non-orthodox approach for teaching these skills. I go straight to the point to fulfil your goals. No pointless generic programming lessons, **you will be mindblown by how much you gained in efficiency and productivity right from the start**.
- **Neurophysiological signal processing in Python.** Learn how to process bodily signals using the most cutting-edge techniques using Python, a simple, free and powerful language. This will allow you to cut your dependence on expensive software like Biopac's Acknowledge or Matlab, invest that license money elsewhere and become more resilient and **future-proof**!
<!-- - **Others**. Get in touch if you have other ideas. -->
