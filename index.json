Like (your) reality was dull and boring as compared to the fictional world you were immersed in? Yearning to stay in longer, and at the same time knowing well that it had to come to an end? You might have experienced what we can call Cypher‚Äôs Complex.\nIn the movie The Matrix, Cypher is a ‚Äúredpill‚Äù, i.e., an individual that has been awaken from the matrix (a virtual world). However, he becomes disappointed and unhappy with the true nature of reality, and actively seeks to return to the illusory world of the matrix. Interestingly, he also explicitly desires to forget everything about the true reality, as if keeping the awareness of living in an illusion could prevent him from fully enjoying it.\n\u0026#34;You know.. I know this steak doesn\u0026#39;t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth; the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years.. you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.\u0026#34; From a scientific perspective, the latter part can find some echo in the down-regulatory effect of fictional reappraisal. In a few studies, we showed that believing that a stimulus is ‚Äúfictional‚Äù (not real) dampens our emotional state. Tucciarelli et al. (2023) also showed that the simple knowledge that a set of images of faces contains AI-generated images decreased the perceived trustworthiness of all the faces. These results suggest that being aware that the causes of our experience (the events and stimuli) are fictional can be a barrier to enjoyment and engagement. And yet, the desire to supplant reality with a fictional world can be found in real life.\nCypher‚Äôs Complex is common in mild forms. Examples can be found in the feelings of emptiness, disconnection and dullness (itself a transient and mild form of depersonalization/derealization) that follows the return from an engaging fictional world (be it in a novel, a movie or a video-game). For instance, many reported feeling blue after watching the Avatar (2009) movie, to the extent where it has been coined the ‚Äúpost-Avatar depression syndrome‚Äù. Most of the time, the negative affects passes, and the dissonance gets resolved either through closure (acceptance of the fictional or impermanent nature of the alternative reality), or a compromise that allows the fictional world to take a delimited space in one‚Äôs reality. For example, people might engage in activities (e.g., role playing games) or create content (writing a book or doing fan art) to integrate the fictional world into their reality.\nHowever, Cypher‚Äôs Complex can also give rise to more severe issues with conscious or unconscious attempts at forgetting or ignoring reality (delusions, denial, ‚Ä¶), which can lead to dire outcomes.\nInterested in doing research related to effects of reality and fiction?

And as I am officially starting a new faculty position at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK, the lab is moving too.\nTo give a bit of perspective, we started as the ‚ÄúReality Bending League‚Äù, which was the unofficial name of the team working with me (‚ÄúLeague‚Äù was chosen to keep the lab‚Äôs acronym, ReBeL). It then became a semi-official group in 2021, when I became a semi-independent PI after being awarded a transition grant from NTU. And with 2023 comes our fully official start.\nReBeL logo (2020-2022). To mark this (re)birth anniversary, we are changing our logo. As much as I loved the old one - which was packed with symbols, it was arguably a bit too‚Ä¶ extravagant. Something more sleek and minimal felt good with respect to the lab‚Äôs newly acquired legitimacy. I know that many will prefer the old-‚Ä¶ sorry, the vintage- logo, and I must say it wasn‚Äôt easy for me to move forward with the change. Perhaps it will make a come-back in the future in another form, who knows!\nThe new logo contains 3 symbols. The curved spoon is a reference to the Matrix scene where a kid shows Neo how to bend a spoon, which is a metaphor for reality (hence of the name of the lab, reality bending).\nIn the movie, Neo becomes able to control reality by becoming aware of its illusory nature, and of the predominant role of one‚Äôs Self in its generation.\n\u0026#34;Try to realize the truth... There is no spoon. Then you\u0026#39;ll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\u0026#34; The second meaning of the logo is the Psi Greek letter, symbol of psychology, formed by the spoon and the white vertical line.\nThe logo of the APA features the Psi letter. Thirdly, the black rectangles represent open doors, which is a good illustration of progress, research, discovery and‚Ä¶ consciousness expansion? Interestingly, Jim Morrison named its band ‚ÄúThe Doors‚Äù in reference to a quote by William Blake, who said that when ‚Äúthe doors of perception were cleansed then everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite‚Äù.\nTo share a blooper, here is an alternative direction for the logo that wasn‚Äôt selected, that incorporated the spoon and the open door in another way.

In particular, editing can be used to handle the temporal unfolding of events represented in a movie. Nevertheless, little is known about how different editing types impact viewers' time perception. In an exploratory on-line study (90 participants) and a pre-registered conceptual replication study (60 participants), we asked participants to judge (Study 1) or reproduce (Study 2) the duration of 45 excerpts of the movie \"Le Ballon Rouge\" containing either continuous editing, action discontinuity editing or no editing. Each excerpt was formatted in three durations (2000, 2500 or 3000 ms). In both studies, we reported that scenes containing continuous editing were perceived as longer than the other two scene types. Moreover, scenes containing action discontinuity editing were perceived as longer than scenes with no editing.

On top of revealing complex neuronal processes of the brain that may not be possible with linear approaches, EEG complexity measures have also demonstrated their potential as biomarkers of psychopathology such as depression and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the opacity of algorithms and descriptions originating from mathematical concepts have made it difficult to understand what complexity is and how to draw consistent conclusions when applied within psychology and neuropsychiatry research. In this review, we provide an overview and entry-level explanation of existing EEG complexity measures, which can be broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity. We then synthesize complexity findings across different areas of psychological science, namely, in consciousness research, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as changes across the lifespan, while addressing some theoretical and methodological issues underlying the discrepancies in the data. Finally, we present important considerations when choosing and interpreting these metrics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Brain entropy, fractal dimensions and predictability: A review of complexity measures for EEG in healthy and neuropsychiatric populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","An Shu Te","Tam Pham","Zen J.

Unfortunately, few studies compare the relationship and objective performance of the plethora of existing metrics, in turn hindering reproducibility, replicability, consistency, and clarity in the field. Using the NeuroKit2 Python software, we computed a list of 112 (predominantly used) complexity indices on signals varying in their characteristics (noise, length and frequency spectrum). We then systematically compared the indices by their computational weight, their representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions, and empirical proximity with other indices. Based on these considerations, we propose that a selection of 12 indices, together representing 85.97% of the total variance of all indices, might offer a parsimonious and complimentary choice in regards to the quantification of the complexity of time series. Our selection includes CWPEn, Line Length (LL), BubbEn, MSWPEn, MFDFA (Max), Hjorth Complexity, SVDEn, MFDFA (Width), MFDFA (Mean), MFDFA (Peak), MFDFA (Fluctuation), AttEn.

Instead, scientists have to craft them by hand in an idiosyncratic fashion, or use pre-made images not tailored for the specific needs of their studies. This, in turn, hinders the reproducibility of illusion-based research, narrowing possibilities for scientific breakthroughs and their applications.

The problem of possible lack of power, and thus possible false positives, can also be combined with the desire for stringent multiple comparisons / tests ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù.\nIn many real-life scenarios, we simply cannot increase the sample size (because of money, time, COVID or any other reason). And sometimes, the many tests / comparisons are all needed as we have many hypotheses or variables. Naturally, the best pre-study weapon against power-related issues are preregistration (and registered-reports) with proper power-analysis.\nThat being said, imagine that for one reason or another we don‚Äôt have that. We cannot recruit more participants and have to deal with the data that what we have. What can we do?\nSome useful tips can be grouped and referred to as PoSCA (Power, Stringency, Coherence, Acknowledgment):\nPower: Don‚Äôt waste power Use all the information that you have. In particular, the information within participants (if you have multiple trials per participant, don‚Äôt average over them!), by using methods such as mixed-models. Stringent significance Increase the significance threshold, either arbitrarily (e.g., lower the p-value threshold to .005; Ioannidis, 2018) or pseudo-arbitrarily (using multiple-comparisons corrections such as the Bonferroni method). This, under the Bayesian framework, is (somewhat) equivalent to being more script with whatever indices that we use. For instance, consider only Bayes Factors (BF) \u0026gt; 30 instead of 10, or Probabilities of Direction (pd) of 99.9% instead of 97%, or widening the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE). Constrain the parameters towards 0. We can also make it harder for models to have parameters (i.e., ‚Äúeffects‚Äù) that deviate from 0. This is easy to do within the Bayesian framework by setting narrower priors centred around 0. This will naturally pull (known as ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù) the results towards 0 and is a natural way of ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù for false positives. Under the frequentist framework, there are methods of regularization that can introduce a bias, such as LASSO or Ridge regressions. Coherence: cross-validate results There is a need to look at the bigger picture, including non-significant and ‚Äútrending‚Äù effects. Look at all the data together, and all the variables measuring related concepts: do the results go in the same direction? Are they internally coherent? Do they follow the same trend? In a small sample study, I would trust more a conclusion based on 10 tests with independent indices measuring aspects related to ‚Äúdepression‚Äù, all barely significant but going in the same direction, over one super-significant (but possibly cherry-picked) result interpreted as a proof of the effect of ‚Äúdepression‚Äù in general. In other words, don‚Äôt focus on ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù effects and assess results in their entirety. Acknowledgment: be honest and humble Quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis. Maybe an effect is not ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there is a lot of evidence that it has no effect either. Quantifying evidence against the null can be easily done using for instance Bayes Factors. Be honest and acknowledge the limited power of the study. Don‚Äôt try to hide it. Temper the interpretation of the results. Don‚Äôt over-interpret them if they are not super robust. Science must be open, replicable \u0026amp; reproductible, slow, and based on methodological best-practices. But first and foremost, it must be honest.\nReferences Ioannidis, J. P. (2018).

This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity.

Including data analysis as Supplementary Materials can be a tedious task. How can we simplify the sharing of our work? So that it can be fully appreciated, as well as evaluated, improved, worked on, in a transparent and open way?\nOption 1: Dump the code in a word file Most publication portals don‚Äôt directly accept code scripts to be included ‚Äúas is‚Äù. In other words, you cannot upload your manuscript and your .R script just like that. So one option is to copy its content, paste it in a word / pdf document, and Voil√†!\nBut what if you don‚Äôt have code because you use a point-and-click software? Well, you can note down all the x,y coordinates of your clicks so that one can reproduce the steps and all the clicks. Just kidding, if you don‚Äôt have a script, then may god have mercy on your soul.\nWhy is that a terrible solution? Because let‚Äôs face it, unstructured code dumps are horrific. Nobody wants to read it, it does not make justice to your work, and it‚Äôs still tedious to create! You have to re-do it everytime you modify your code. And it‚Äôs even worse if you want to include all the outputs, figures, tables that are generated by the code? Data analysis is not just the code, but everything that comes with it and that allowed you to make the conclusions that you made.\nOption 2: Use Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a ‚Äúframework‚Äù that allows you to have files (.Rmd) that can contain a mix of text and code (and not only R, but also Python for instance!).\nIt can be used to write comprehensive ‚Äúreports‚Äù that include all your thoughts, motivations and interpretations of the results. And the great thing about it is that these files can be converted into beautiful and readable documents like PDF, Word or HTML. It will automatically embed the code and its generated output (as text, tables or figures) alongside the text.\nIt is an awesome way to write statistical reports, and can even be used to create many other non-stats related stuff, like APA-formatted manuscripts (great for preprints), books, presentation slides, websites or blogs. It‚Äôs a must-have skill for every researcher.\nAnd it gets better!\nOption 3: Use our Results Template In the Reality Bending team, we like to have our different projects and studies organized in a consistent way. We heavily use GitHub to store our projects and collaborate on them, and we also like the possibility of making these projects open and accessible (i.e., easy to discover and explore) when the time comes.\nThat‚Äôs why we came up with a Template folder for storing the materials related to a given study, including well-organized analysis scripts. And what‚Äôs great about it is that it is setup in a way that allows you to generate multiple files format (word, pdf, html) with a single click (and even without any click, in a fully automatic way)! And what‚Äôs even greater is that if you decide to upload it to GitHub, you‚Äôll have a whole website presenting your data analysis!\nWe use it to have reproducible analysis that we can easily share with publications. We can upload the .pdf or .docx file generated by the template as Supplementary Materials, but we also link the URL of the online repository of the study in the manuscript, where users can access and experience the content in the format that they prefer. It really improves the appeal of a study when the results are trustworthy.\nAll this is easily made possible with our template.

The image makes ‚Äúsense‚Äù overall; there are well-defined shapes and objects, that seem to be placed in a plausible - albeit chaotic - fashion, like some random rubbish thrown in the corner of a room. Even the colors, the lightning, the quality, is coherent, and helps making it believable. And yet, chances are you cannot name one single element that composes it.\nThis image, after appearing on twitter in April 2019, surfaced on reddit with the caption ‚ÄúThis picture is designed to give the viewer the simulated experience of having a stroke (particularly in the occipital lobe of the cerebral cortex, where visual perception occurs.) Everything looks hauntingly familiar but you just can‚Äôt quite recognize anything‚Äù, and became subsequently viral. However, the author of the caption later admitted that he made this description up.\nSo where does the image come from?\nOne can trace back the original publication to an instagram account, which author declared having made the image using ArtBreeder.com. This website gives access to an AI algorithm (Generative Adversarial Networks - GAN), commonly used in the processing and generation of images (one mindblowing example can be found on thispersondoesnotexist.com, which generates realistic pictures of non-existing people). There were even some attempts to reverse engineer the process to retrieve what the original image could have been like.\nAfter all, it seems like there is no intelligent design behind this image. No clever neuropsychologist carefully crafting a meaningful experience. Just one of these lucky accident.\nNonetheless, it‚Äôs still an intriguing image, falling in this uncanny abyss of things that we recognize as familiar, but slightly too alien for our sense-seeking brains to dissolve in meaning. Could it tell something about brain processes? Surely, but brain disorders? Maybe.\nThe ‚Äúoccipital stroke‚Äù hypothesis mentioned above suggests, by its formulation, a lesion to the primary visual cortices. However, as neuroscientists know, these brain regions, located at the extreme back of the brain, are mostly supporting lower level aspects of visual processing, and their damage is usually related to alterations of a somewhat different nature than of that above, such as vision loss, visual hallucinations, visual deformations, loss of color, movement, stereoscopy, etc.\nHowever, there is another neuropsychological disorder, referred to as ‚Äúvisual agnosia‚Äù, in which patients experience difficulties to recognize visually presented objects, despite preserving an intact vision. In fact, it is more an umbrella term for different subcategories of deficits, and the image above could be reminiscent of visual agnosia of the associative type, which corresponds to a a specific impairment in the assignment of meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived (and can be visually described). This symptom is often related to injuries in the left occipito-temporal region, located on the ventral ‚Äúwhat‚Äù stream of the brain (as opposed to the so-called ‚Äúwhere‚Äù dorsal stream).\nIvan Seal‚Äôs Art From there, the youtuber Solar Sands helped me discover the artist Ivan Seal, which work is somewhat akin to the image above.

Their infinitely self-replicating nature illustrates how complex patterns can emerge from very simple rules. But the history of religions and comparative mythology are other hobbies of mine, and today I have a little story about fractals, God, or Hell.\nScience and Religions People often tend to see religion and science as opposites, one obscurantist and the other enlightening, but such generalization overlooks the vast differences between religions, and thus in the world‚Äôs understanding of their followers.\nLet‚Äôs take as example some (mostly extinct) religions, like the polytheisms from antiquity. While the interest in humans of the major Gods was often limited (unless it‚Äôs about beautiful girls, Zeus we see you!), it was usually considered that regular Men have little say in their destiny, and little power to change it. They were toys in Gods‚Äô hands, tools at the mercy of their power struggles and agendas not always in line with any form of anthropic benevolence.\nThe Fates presiding on Human\u0026#39;s destinies, from Disney\u0026#39;s Hercules (1997). In other faiths and philosophies (e.g., Eastern traditions), the world is understood at vastly different scale, and the notion of Self (and/or ‚Äúsoul‚Äù) is extended to encompass many lives. The ultimate goal of breaking the cycle of reincarnation and suffering and ascend to higher states of being is layed out over many lives and, for most people, there isn‚Äôt much they can do in only one life to escape it. If anything, they must follow a just path, minimize karmic loss, and seek the ‚Äútruth‚Äù within themselves. A process of Self-mastery and introspection facilitated by various practices, such as meditation.\nOther religions, refered to as ‚Äúorthopraxic‚Äù, are more than mere beliefs systems (e.g., Islam, as well as some currents of Judeism) and expect followers to follow a set of behaviours and conducts, codifying many aspects of life. The ‚Äútruth‚Äù has already been revealed to mankind, and we have the choice of following it - and be saved - or not - and be damned. Importantly for our topic, the ‚Äútruth‚Äù is often contained directly in the scriptures, and can only be attained by studying and learning the sacred texts (with varying degrees of possible interpretation).\nChristianity is different in regards to several aspects. The history of Chritiniarty led it to regards to several aspects.\nCorruption Decadent leaders Crusades Inquisition\nOne can get closer to God by studying his creation, the world.\nOther religions, personal responsability is even further simplified:\nWhat does it have to do with fractals?

The logic behind this assumption is that an advanced civilization, with enormous computing power, might want to create agents with a powerful artificial intelligence, that would be evolving in a simulated world (think of an infinitely more advanced The Sims Game). These sims (i.e., the virtual intelligences populating the simulation) might be endowed with consciousness, and live their lives in this world, unable to distinguish its simulated nature from the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù reality. Moreover, similarly to games that are running on many computers in the world, there could be an important number of these simulated worlds. Moreover, it could reach a point where a simulation could be created inside another simulation. Thus, the number of ‚Äúsims‚Äù would quickly exceed the number of consciousness‚Äôs living in the primary (i.e., non-computer-generated) reality. Consequently, it is statistically plausible that we are, indeed, simulated ‚Äúsims‚Äù living in a simulated reality.\nAliens watching episode 2020 of \u0026#34;the Earth\u0026#34; unfold, horrified. It is to note that Bostrom‚Äôs argument has been criticized, mocked, revised and updated several times. But beyond the flaws in its argumentation and premisses, it is still a fairly appealing thought experiment, and a fascinating possibility. People have been mis-representing this argument, picturing some alien species playing The Sims with us on mega computers. But albeit Bostrom indeed mostly presents it as a simulation run by other intelligent agents, this idea could be generalized. The simulating system could take many forms, not necessarily created by an intelligent design. It just means that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúthing‚Äù (a very scientific term, I know) outside the universe that gives rise to it, one way of another.\nWhat does it change for our lives? Pretty much nothing. Indeed, this thrilling hypothesis is somehow irrelevant from a phenomenological and psychological perspective, for the majority of people cannot help but experience a fully deployed sense of reality. They are (normally) endowed with an intuitive feeling and belief that they are real, existing and belonging to a real world. They rarely doubt it, and even if they do so, it is mostly in a philosophical fashion, that does not entail a genuine sensation of uncertainty toward the nature of the world. This sense of reality is fascinating topic on its own (though I‚Äôm biased since its my main research topic), independent from the issue of the nature of the universe. Though we could argue that the latter opens up the possibility of tears in the objective reality (either bugs of the system or ways of accessing and modifying the fabric of reality), but this Matrix-like aspect of the simulated reality hypothesis is a topic for another time.\nSo no, the universe being a simulation, aside from being a breath-taking metaphysical consideration, changes practically nothing for our daily lives.\nDetermism Let‚Äôs put aside this idea of a simulated universe for now and think about determinism. I consider myself, for now, as an ultra-determinist (I should rather say, ‚Äúthe world has made me into a determinist‚Äù). It means that I believe that the universe is unfolding according to some causality laws (many of which are not yet fully known), and that since the origin of the universe (e.g., the Big Bang), things have been evolving according to the only one possible chain of event. Naturally, the hard version of determinism leaves no room for free will (though the illusion of free will is important) and creates some issues when it comes to responsibility (again, a topic for another time).\nNote that this position is not incompatible with a probabilistic view of the world (I am also a rather radical Bayesianist üòÅ). In this context, the probabilistic perspective is mostly a framework to describe uncertainty and hidden mechanisms. For instance, if I flip a coin, a probabilistic approach would be to consider that there is a 50/50 probability on the outcome. That said, if we manage to gather information on all the parameters (the starting position of the coin, the velocity and angle of the tossing, gravity, the weight distribution on the coin, its resistance to air, characteristics of air pressure, wind etc.), one could pretty much accurately predict what the outcome would be. In other words, the outcome is already ‚Äúdetermined‚Äù once the coined has been tossed. That doesn‚Äôt mean that a probabilistic model is not convenient to describe it, especially when we don‚Äôt have access to all these parameters (or powerful enough models to integrate them).\nMany attempts have been made to attack determinism (and especially by people trying to defend the possibility of free will), and recent advances in physics have giving them a lot of ammunition (the most ‚Ä¶","date":1605225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605225600,"objectID":"2ca70da4494c0823bd66f41907e15c9f","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2020-11-13-time_computational_limit/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-11-13-time_computational_limit/","section":"post","summary":"Note: this is a thought-experiment, not to be taken too seriously.\nWe live in a simulated universe In his famous simulation argument, the transhumanist Bostrom (2003, 2011) posits that we are living in a computer-generated reality.","tags":["Reality","Time","Determinism","Transhumanism","Science fiction"],"title":"Time as a computational limit","type":"post"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["Psychology","Neuropsychology"],"content":"As you know, reality bending is my primary research direction. However, it is not (yet) a well-established scientific topic, nor is it clearly defined. In fact, it is not defined at all, hence the purpose of this article.\nBut what does it refer too? Is it some kind of Avatar: The Last Airbender thing? Or some Avengers-style superpower? Well‚Ä¶ I sure wish it was üòÅ\nEssentially, reality bending refers to the study of the internal and external determinants of subjective reality. In other words, we seek to understand the processes that modulate our conscious experience of reality. The word ‚Äúbending‚Äù encapsulates the active nature of the mechanisms at stake. Indeed, being anything but stable, our perception of reality can be quite easily influenced, whether voluntarily or not, sometimes to extreme degrees of alteration.\nDaumier, H. (1925), Don Quixote attacking the windmills. Reality benders seek to unravel the structure and mechanisms of the sense of reality by studying natural instances of its distortion, or by directly inducing them through a variety of means.\nObjective and subjective determinants of the sense of reality Let‚Äôs take for example a guy watching some episode of his favourite TV show, Friends. As he swiftly moves from laughing to snivelling, we can confidently say that he is fully immersed in the show. He feels like he‚Äôs present in the show, from which the fictional characters feel very real: for a moment, his brain processes the perceived experience almost as if it was real.\nWhat leads to this high sense of reality? First, there are objective characteristics of the experience (or rather, of the external source of the experience), i.e., characteristics of the environment. Here, it‚Äôs a realistic stimulus displayed on a flat screen. But one could wonder what would happen if the sensory input was richer (imagine being physically IN the show by means of some super virtual reality setup), or poorer (the same story presented as comic strips with the characters portrayed as stick figures).\nHowever, while such manipulations could indeed be used to manipulate our immersion, there is also a subjective component contributing to our sense of reality, related for instance to the affective response, attentional engagement, or self-relevance, that will cause a stimulus to strum unique strings in each individual, depending on his history and state of mind.\nTell me your reality and I‚Äôll tell you who you are The fact that the sense of reality is, in the end, a subjective experience, means that is is intrinsically connected to the Self (i.e., our physical and mental identity). As such, aside from studying how our sense of reality is influenced by external and internal factors, but also investigate the reverse relationship, i.e., how the variability of our sense of reality can inform us about oneself.\nNote that, although the focus is the subjective aspect of reality, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we deny the existence, or downplay the importance, of objective reality. Stating that most of our experience is ‚Äúmade-up‚Äù (i.e., is a construction of the brain) does not equate absolute relativism (more on that in another post). Objective truths and facts do exist, and are essential to seek.\nAltered states of consciousness Naturally, states in which our sense of reality is distorted (as compared to the consensual collective experience) are of particular interest as models or study-cases of our ideas and theories. They include long-term affections (e.g., neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) or transcient states (induced by psychoactive substances or specific practices like meditation and trance).\nThanks for reading!

This single index is often derived from several ‚Äútrials‚Äù. For instance, the reaction times in the condition A (let‚Äôs say, the baseline) will be averaged together, and the same will be done with the condition B. Finally, the difference between these two means will be used an the individual score for a given participant.\nHowever, we can intuitively feel that we lose a lot of information when averaging these scores. Do we deal appropriately with the variability related to individuals, conditions, or the noise aggravated by potential outliers? This is especially important when working with a limited amount of trials.\nWith the advent of recent computational advances, new easy-to-implement alternatives emerge. For instance, one can ‚Äúmodel‚Äù the effects at an individual level (e.g., the simplest case, for the two conditions paradigm described above, would be a linear regression with the condition as a unique predictor), and use the parameters of each model as individual scores (e.g., the ‚Äúslope‚Äù coefficient of the effect of the manipulation), rather than the raw mean. This opens up the possibility of including covariates and take into account other sources of known variability, which could lead to better estimates.\nHowever, individual models are also sensitive to outliers and noise. Thus, another possibility is to model the effects at the population level and, at the same time, at the individual level. This can be achieved by modelling the participants as a random factor in a mixed model. In this case, the individual estimates might benefit from the population estimates. In other words, the effects at the population level will ‚Äúconstrain‚Äù or ‚Äúguide‚Äù the estimation at an individual level to potentially limit extreme parameters.\nUnfortunately, the above method requires to have all the data at hand, to be able to fit the population model. This is often not the case in on-going acquisition, or in neuropsychological contexts, in which the practitioners simply acquire data for one patient, and have to compute individual scores, without having access to the detailed population data. Thus, an in-between alternative could make use of Bayesian models, in which the population effects (for instance, the mean effect of the condition) could be entered as an informative prior in the individual models to, again, ‚Äúguide‚Äù the estimation at an individual level and hopefully limit the impact of noise or outliers observations.\nIn this post, the aim is to compare these 4 methods (basic individual model - equivalent to using the raw mean, population model, individual model with informative priors) in recovering the ‚Äútrue‚Äù effects using a simulated dataset.\nResults Generate Data We generate several datasets in which we manipulate the number of participants, in which the score of interest is the effect of a manipulation as compared to a baseline condition. 20 trials per condition will be generated with a known ‚Äútrue‚Äù effect (the centre of the distribution from which the data is generated). Gaussian noise of varying standard deviation will be added to create a natural variability (See the functions‚Äô definition below).\nlibrary(tidyverse) library(easystats) data \u0026lt;- get_data(n_participants=1000, n_trials=20) results \u0026lt;- get_results(data) Figure 1: Example of a dataset containing 20 participants (shown with different colors). As can be seen, we introduced modulations in the inter- and intra- individual variability. We will then compare the scores obtained by each method to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù score of each participant by substracting them from one another. As such, for each method, we obtain the absolute ‚Äúdistance‚Äù from the true score.\nFit model Contrast analysis will be applied to compare the different methods together.\nmodel \u0026lt;- lm(Diff_Abs ~ Method, data=results) modelbased::estimate_contrasts(model) %\u0026gt;% arrange(Difference) %\u0026gt;% mutate(Level1 = stringr::str_remove(Level1, \u0026#34;Diff_\u0026#34;), Level2 = stringr::str_remove(Level2, \u0026#34;Diff_\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% select(Level1, Level2, Difference, CI_low, CI_high, p) ## Level1 | Level2 | Difference | CI | p ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## IndividualModel_Priors | PopulationModel | -1.85e-03 | [-0.01, 0.01] | \u0026gt; .999 ## IndividualModel_Freq | PopulationModel | 1.70e-03 | [-0.01, 0.01] | \u0026gt; .999 ## IndividualModel_Freq | IndividualModel_Priors | 3.55e-03 | [-0.01, 0.01] | \u0026gt; .999 Visualize the results Figure 2: Average accuracy of the different methods (the closest to 0 the better).

Pick one young and brilliant neuropsychologist and ask ‚Äúwhat is neuropsychology?‚Äù. In some cases, after a few seconds of hesitation, you could hear answers like ‚Äúbeing a neuropsychologist means doing this or that‚Äù. In other cases, you might come across incomplete - or even false - responses, such as ‚Äúneuropsychology is a tool‚Äù, ‚Äúa method‚Äù, ‚Äúa paradigm‚Äù, or even worse, ‚Äúa point of view‚Äù.\nThat does not mean that our neuropsychologist is incompetent, far from it. But formally defining our field as a whole is not an exercise that we are used to do. Indeed, the training in neuropsychology usually comes in a fragmented way, little by little. A bit of cognitive neuroscience here, a bit of neuropsychological syndromes there, some cognitive tests administration over here, and some cortical neuroanatomy over there‚Ä¶ Though we might, in fine, acquire a global vision and understanding of neuropsychology, verbalizing it is seldom necessary.\nThe definition of neuropsychology is actually quite complex to formalize, and can even be hotly debated. The jobs and positions that stem out of this field are many, and practitioners often tend to circumscribe neuropsychology to their own activity. For instance, a neuropsychologist that mainly does cognitive rehabilitation with psychiatric patients might have quite a different vision from another that does, day after day, presurgical cognitive assessments. And that is without mentioning the neuropsychologists pursuing an academic career, or even the ones that have moved to the private sector.\nNo problem, would argue the careful reader, if the definitions are too narrow, let‚Äôs take more general one. It‚Äôs not that simple. Indeed, neuropsychology occupies a very particular place in the network of science, as it is at the crossroads between social sciences, biological sciences and medical fields. Giving a definition that is too large would lose its essence in the nebulous depths of neuroscience and psychology, which would be not be accurate; neuropsychologists, whether they are clinical practitioners or not, have a common training, a specific theoretical grounding, as well as a unique interpretation and analysis framework underpinned by a scientifically rigorous method. Taking these elements into account, I will attempt to give a simple, comprehensive and informative definition of neuropsychology.\nThe first axiom that we need to discuss is the notion of science. Is neuropsychology its ‚Äúown‚Äù scientific field, or is it a mere portion of another one, such as cognitive neuroscience or psychology, which differs from other specializations only through its object of interest? ‚ÄúBy science‚Äù, says Schopenhauer in his PhD thesis with a baroque title (On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason), ‚Äúwe understand a system of notions, i.e. a totality of connected, as opposed to a mere aggregate of disconnected, notions.‚Äù This definition applies well to neuropsychology, that contains a set of theories, hypotheses, methods and proofs feeding from one another and creating a coherent ensemble. As such, neuropsychology is its own scientific discipline, although a singular one‚Ä¶\nIndeed, what is the ‚Äúbigger‚Äù box in which neuropsychology fits? While neuropsychologists are often initially trained in psychology, one could argue that the focus on the brain makes it more belonging to neuroscience. Well, the organization and structure of Science is a complicated issue. However, the particularity of the topographical location of neuropsychology is quite apparent.\nOn the one hand, neuropsychology belongs to a cluster of sciences interested a specific biological organ: the brain. As such, neuropsychology is an integral part of neuroscience. On the other hand, neuropsychology is interested in the productions of the brain (e.g., thoughts, feelings and behaviours) with a focus on the cognitive level (analyzing things in terms of cognitive processes and mechanisms), which makes it also belonging to psychology. Moreover, one could argue that neuropsychology, through its integration of the study of what we are biologically, and who we are mentally, has been connected to, and used as evidence in, philosophy of mind debates (for instance, famous neuropsychological cases studied by Sacks, Ramachandran or Milner have been widely discussed by contemporary philosophers). Finally, contrary to many other domains, neuropsychology has also an applied, practical component, that can be used in clinical practice. This clinical aspect, registering neuropsychology withing medical fields, takes multiple forms, such as assessment, diagnostic or therapeutic care, and can be used with a wide variety of patients and illnesses. These multiple facets make the wealth of neuropsychology, which offers an exceptional freedom of practice.\nAs we have seen, neuropsychology is located at the centre of colliding galaxies of knowledge, such as neuroscience, psychology, medicine and ‚Ä¶","date":1599955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599955200,"objectID":"307c6836540eb5c8ed073bd753bb5a79","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2020-09-13-what_is_neuropsychology/","publishdate":"2020-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-09-13-what_is_neuropsychology/","section":"post","summary":"In which I discuss the place of neuropsychology in the galaxy of sciences, its structure and its definition.","tags":["Neuropsychology","Epistemology","Psychology","Definition"],"title":"What is neuropsychology?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel L√ºdecke","Mattan S.

This article is not an advertisement for it, but rather a perspective on the role of technical social networks in psychology. I already mentioned in another post that technical aspects and skills will play an increasing role in psychology. This relationship isn‚Äôt by any means new. More than a century ago, pioneering psychologists were demonstrating formidable engineering and craftsmanship skills to build new tools and apparatuses to measure what they were interested in (see for instance Nicolas \u0026amp; Makowski, 2016). But years have gone by, and the digital revolution has happened. As a result, most of the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù aspects (a rather vague term covering everything that is not related to the semantic knowledge of psychological theories and facts) are now ultimately tied to software. Critically, your ability to use these softwares will determine the speed and ease at which you can achieve your goals and produce high quality assignments.\nAs an example, during my studies, most of the statistics course was delivered through the usage of one particular software (Statistica¬© ü§Æ). At the exam, your score didn‚Äôt much depend on your understanding of what a t-test is, when to use it or anything like that; but rather on your knowledge of the software, and your ability to click on the right buttons faster than your peers. While this is an unfortunate example that can be used to criticize the reliance on tools rather than fundamental knowledge, it also tells us something about the reality of the current world. In research, the better you are for instance at data processing (which involves both the knowledge of how to navigate the software and the knowledge of what to do in general), the faster you will be able to carry it out, and the less stressed you will be, resulting in a cascade of other positive outcomes (increased well-being, work-quality, productivity, opportunities, etc.).\nHowever, one common mistake is to delay learning new stuff (especially things outside our comfort zone) until we have no choice. This is understandable given that in the short term, certain skills may not be absolutely needed (i.e., you can manage without them) and acquiring them can be a steep learning curve (which can be hard, frustrating and effortful). However, you should start investing in your technical skills as soon as possible (as the time devoted to learning will only shrink as you advance) if you don‚Äôt want to become very close friends with pressure, stress, hatred, frustration and despair. So stay on the light side of the force and embrace the future.\nA psychology researcher realizing that he should have learned programming earlier. And it‚Äôs not just about learning to use some software just for the sake of having things done and getting faster results. A lot of science is done through software, not only with them. People are actively discussing new methods, algorithms and tools that then expand like never before the possibilities of researchers. Flaming debates have been going on with frameworks and workflows clashing with thunderous sparks (for instance, Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics, ANOVAs vs. (mixed) regressions, etc.), and these calls for change find echo because of developments of software, allowing initiated users to test, validate and use new methods.\nOpen-access software It might not seem like it when you‚Äôre studying it at the university, but science is currently in the middle of a revolution. A massive paradigmatic change, partly fuelled by the growth of open-science, which covers aspects like open-access and open-source. This means, for software, that they are no longer being developed by private companies and sold for money. Instead, they are developed in a public fashion, and everybody is welcome to chime in and provide input, suggestions, report bugs or improve the code.\nOpen-source development means faster and better software, and more importantly, the creation of a true connection between developers and users. In fact, the former are often first and foremost also the latter, meaning that in a lot of cases (at least, mine üòÖ), people started writing a software because they needed it for their own personal job.\nBut the beauty lies in the fact that users can seemingly become developers too, or contributors, at the very least. Sometimes, users end up on a software development page to solve a bug or an issue that they encountered. From there, there can start following the developments, and getting involved. And not necessarily be writing code. It can be by answering to other issues, helping other users, reporting bugs and typos, improving the documentation, giving ideas and suggestions, testing new features and encouraging the developers. There are so many to contribute to the development and, as a result, become an active member of the open-science community. And moreover, doing so is also a great way to learn the theoretical bits. ‚Ä¶","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590537600,"objectID":"9611f20f48cb1435ddd92aac53335f9d","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/post/2020-05-27-github_psychologists/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-05-27-github_psychologists/","section":"post","summary":"Top reasons why engaging into GitHub will give you the edge and benefit psychological science.","tags":["Github","Psychology","Programming","Psychologist","Open science"],"title":"Why psychologists should join GitHub","type":"post"},{"authors":["Philippe Blond√©","Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590105600,"objectID":"38c37ca338d7a4ce93456aa1c2657813","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/blonde2020medio/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blonde2020medio/","section":"publication","summary":"Episodic memory encoding is highly influenced by the availability of attentional resources. Mind wandering corresponds to a shift of attention toward task-unrelated thoughts. Few studies, however, have tested this link between memory encoding and mind wandering. The goal of the present work was to systematically investigate the influence of mind wandering during encoding on episodic memory performances in an ecological setting. Fifty-two participants were asked to navigate in a virtual urban environment. During the walk, they encountered different scenes that, unbeknownst to the participants, were target items presented in a subsequent recognition task associated with a Remember‚ÄìKnow‚ÄìGuess paradigm. Each item triggered, after a random interval, a thought probe assessing current mind wandering. We found a significant linear positive relationship between the ratio of correctly recognized items and the overall mind wandering reported after the task. Moreover, we found a quadratic reversed U-shaped relationship between the probability of giving a ‚ÄòRemember‚Äô response and both on-line and mind wandering reported a posteriori. The nearer to the medium value the level of mind wandering was, the higher was the probability to have a recollection-based recognition. Our results indicate that in a complex environment, the highest probability of actually remembering a scene would be when participants present a medium attentional level: neither distracted by inner thoughts nor too focused on the environment. This open attentional state would allow a better global processing of the environment by preventing one‚Äôs attention from being captured by internal thoughts or narrowed by an over-focusing on the environment.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"In Medio Stat Virtus: intermediate levels of mind wandering improve episodic memory encoding in a virtual environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["R","Python","Psychology"],"content":"Many psychology students or researchers are faced with the challenge - or the opportunity - of learning a programming language. Which one should you learn?\nAs an ex- psych student and a daily user and developer of some of them, here‚Äôs my take on this hot debate.\nWhat has programming to do with psychology? If you‚Äôre a very young psychology student, or a future one, you might wonder: why the heck would I have to learn programming in psychology? ‚ÄúPsychology is kinda like philosophy, it‚Äôs just learning how people‚Äôs minds work by reading books and overthinking stuff‚Äù. If you still think that, you‚Äôre in for one hell of a ride!\nPsychology is, since its very beginning, a hard and experimental science. The founding fathers of psychology were dedicated to find ways to objectively measure psychological phenomena and uncovering the mathematical laws that govern Human behaviour (one of the fields of psychology is even called psychophysics). True, this sciency nature has been toned down by the booming popularity of pseudo-scientific approaches like psychoanalysis throughout the 20th century, that contributed to the stereotypical public image of the shrink doodling while listening to a neurotic patient. But that‚Äôs a distorted and old-fashioned view, not really representative of the future of psychology.\nThe fact is that psychology is very closely connected with statistics. Many great statistical advances were made by psychologists, and all true psychological discoveries are backed by statistical findings. And this importance of statistics is - and will be - growing further, partly due to the recent realization of some major issues in the field due to improper statistical procedures (coined the ‚Äúreplicability crisis‚Äù). Moreover, psychology is more and more relying on advanced data-acquiring methods (smartphone apps, website behaviour data, online surveys, physiological and brain recording devices like EEG, MRI, etc.). And these new formats often require specialized knowledge (web-scraping, database querying, neuroimaging, signal processing, machine learning, ‚Ä¶). And with great data-power comes great data-analysis-responsibilities. Even in the most applied kind of clinical or psychotherapeutic specializations, where you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be safe, they are starting to use data intensive methods like neuro-feedback, virtual reality, experience sampling, and other forms of smartphone sensing and surveying.\nLong story short, no matter which branch of psychology you specialize in, you will be confronted with some technical aspects that won‚Äôt be able to solve with Excel. Moreover, these technical skills are the ones that will make the most difference between students, and that will matter a lot if you want to pursue research or want to go work in the private sector. The golden era where people were recruited in research based on their theoretical expertise is over: technical skills are now the golden ticket to enter - and successfully leave - academia.\nSo, ready to dive into programming? Fear not! It‚Äôs not that complicated. Moreover, it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding skill you can develop. I can assure you that you won‚Äôt regret the time invested in learning it üòä\nBut where should you start?\nLearn both R and Python This increasing relationship between psychology and statistics on the one hand, and other more general technical aspects on the other, is the reason why R and Python are so popular in psychology. Both languages are free, open-source, suited for beginners, and have a large base of users with a ton of learning material online. What‚Äôs the difference between them?\nPut simply, R is for statistics, Python is for the rest.\nSo why is there a virulent debate going on, and a choice to make? It‚Äôs true that I, in theory, would agree with some popular recommandations and suggest learning both, as they are complementary and have their own strengths and weaknesses. I myself use both on a daily basis, so why would preach what I practice?\nThat said, many opinionated people are also arguing in favour of one or the other (usually the only one they know‚Ä¶) will say that learning both is essentially a waste of time. They will put forth a strong argument: you can do whatever you do in R in Python, and vice-versa. In other words, both languages can be used to achieve your goals, so it‚Äôs better to specialize in one than have a limited knowledge of both.\nAlthough I do not agree with that statement, I do acknowledge that people have limited time and resources to learn. Saying ‚Äújust learn both‚Äù is easy, but is arguably an unrealistic expectation for the vast majority of people. So why learning both can be a long-term goal (especially if you want to do research), you have to start somewhere. So, what starter language should you select?\nAsh choosing his starter programming language. He has the choice between R, Python and Bulbasaur, i.e, Matlab - the one that no one likes.

In this study, we investigated the impact of mindfulness on PM. Eighty participants learned 15 cue-action associations.

Before the PM task, participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness or mind wandering (control condition) session. Dispositional mindfulness was measured via the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Although considered as two opposite states, we did not report any difference between the two groups on PM abilities. Nevertheless, the natural tendency to describe one's own sensations (the Describing facet of the FFMQ) predicted time-based performance in both groups. We discuss different hypotheses to explain this finding in light of recent findings on the impact of mind wandering on future oriented cognition. Our main observation is a positive link between the Describing facet and time-based PM performances. We propose that this link could be due to the common association of this mindfulness facets and PM with attentional and interoceptive abilities.

Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of \"significance\" should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their \"behavior\" in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance.

Adopting the Bayesian framework is more of a shift in the paradigm than a change in the methodology; all the common statistical procedures (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, etc.) can also be achieved within the Bayesian framework. One of the core difference is that in the frequentist view, the effects are fixed (but unknown) and data are random. On the other hand, instead of having single estimates of the ‚Äútrue effect‚Äù, the Bayesian inference process computes the probability of different effects given the observed data, resulting in a distribution of possible values for the parameters, called the posterior distribution.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of cardiac phase on different facets of cognitive control. We built a nonemotional cognitive control task to delineate mechanisms such as processing speed, response selection, response inhibition, and conflict monitoring.

Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance.

While various studies have shown that implicit and explicit ER engage partially overlapping neurocognitive processes, the contribution of different executive functions in implicit ER has not been investigated. In the present study, we presented participants with negatively valenced pictures of varying emotional intensity preceded by short texts describing them as either fictional or real. This manipulation was meant to induce a spontaneous emotional down-regulation. We recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) and subjective reports of emotion arousal. Executive functions (updating, switching, and inhibition) were also assessed. No difference was found between the fictional and real condition on EDA. A diminished self-reported arousal was observed, however, when pictures were described as fictional for high- and mild-intensity material, but not for neutral material. The amount of down-regulation in the fictional condition was found to be predicted by interindividual variability in updating performances, but not by the other measures of executive functions, suggesting its implication even in implicit forms of ER.

The few neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have evidenced that midline cortical structures and lateral fronto-parietal regions are more engaged for real and fictional entities, respectively. Interestingly, the former network is engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference, processes that are known to boost emotional reactivity, while the latter underpins emotion regulation. Thus, a possible modulation of the emotional response according to the nature (real or fictional) of the stimulus is conceivable. To test this hypothesis, we presented short emotional (negative and positive) and neutral video as fictional or real. For negative material, we found that subjective emotional experience, but not physiological arousal measured by electrodermal activity, was reduced in the fictional condition. Moreover, the amount of personal memories linked to the scenes counteracted this effect boosting the subjective emotional response. On the contrary, personal memories elicited by the scenes, but not fiction, modulate the emotional response for positive material. These results suggest that when a stimulus triggers a personal memory, the emotional response is less prone to be modulated by contextual factors, and suggest that personal engagement could be responsible for emotional reaction toward fiction. We discuss these results in the emotion regulation framework and underline their implications in informing theoretical accounts of emotion in the neuroscientific domain and the philosophical debate on the paradox of emotional response to fiction.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The paradox of fiction: Emotional response toward fiction and the modulatory role of self-relevance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"68110a20505a874a1b7dc092abec0f6b","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/sperduti2016protective/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2016protective/","section":"publication","summary":"Life expectancy is constantly increasing.

However, in line with observations about the preservation or even the increase of well-being with age, it has been suggested that emotion regulation efficiency follows the same developmental trajectory, remaining stable over time, or even increasing. Emotion regulation refers to a family of strategies aiming at modifying the nature, the intensity, the duration or the expression of emotions. These various strategies rely on different neurocognitive processes in order to be efficient. As these processes are differently affected by aging, some of those strategies appear more affected than others. Thus, elderly people tend to use more frequently situation selection strategies, such as avoiding potentially negative situations, while their ability to regulate an emotion using cognitive reappraisal (ie, changing the meaning of the situation), a strategy drawing heavily on executive resources, appears less efficient than in younger people.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Emotion regulation and the cognitive decline in aging: beyond the paradox","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
