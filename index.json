Is it some kind of Avatar: The Last Airbender thing? Or some Avengers-style superpower? Well\u0026hellip; I sure wish it was üòÅ\nEssentially, reality bending refers to the study of the internal and external determinants of subjective reality. In other words, we seek to understand the processes that modulate our conscious experience of reality. The word \u0026ldquo;bending\u0026rdquo; encapsulates the active nature of the mechanisms at stake. Indeed, being anything but stable, our perception of reality can be quite easily influenced, whether voluntarily or not, sometimes to extreme degrees of alteration.\n Daumier, H. (1925), Don Quixote attacking the windmills.  Reality benders seek to unravel the structure and mechanisms of the sense of reality by studying natural instances of its distortion, or by directly inducing them through a variety of means.\nObjective and subjective determinants of the sense of reality Let\u0026rsquo;s take for example a guy watching some episode of his favourite TV show, Friends. As he swiftly moves from laughing to snivelling, we can confidently say that he is fully immersed in the show. He feels like he\u0026rsquo;s present in the show, from which the fictional characters feel very real: for a moment, his brain processes the perceived experience almost as if it was real.\nWhat leads to this high sense of reality? First, there are objective characteristics of the experience (or rather, of the external source of the experience), i.e., characteristics of the environment. Here, it\u0026rsquo;s a realistic stimulus displayed on a flat screen. But one could wonder what would happen if the sensory input was richer (imagine being physically IN the show by means of some super virtual reality setup), or poorer (the same story presented as comic strips with the characters portrayed as stick figures).\nHowever, while such manipulations could indeed be used to manipulate our immersion, there is also a subjective component contributing to our sense of reality, related for instance to the affective response, attentional engagement, or self-relevance, that will cause a stimulus to strum unique strings in each individual, depending on his history and state of mind.\nTell me your reality and I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you who you are The fact that the sense of reality is, in the end, a subjective experience, means that is is intrinsically connected to the Self (i.e., our physical and mental identity). As such, aside from studying how our sense of reality is influenced by external and internal factors, but also investigate the reverse relationship, i.e., how the variability of our sense of reality can inform us about oneself.\nNote that, although the focus is the subjective aspect of reality, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we deny the existence, or downplay the importance, of objective reality. Stating that most of our experience is \u0026ldquo;made-up\u0026rdquo; (i.e., is a construction of the brain) does not equate absolute relativism (more on that in another post). Objective truths and facts do exist, and are essential to seek.\nAltered states of consciousness Naturally, states in which our sense of reality is distorted (as compared to the consensual collective experience) are of particular interest as models or study-cases of our ideas and theories. They include long-term affections (e.g., neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia) or transcient states (induced by psychoactive substances or specific practices like meditation and trance).\n Thanks for reading!

Several studies suggest that physical features (e.g., symmetry, contrast) of an artwork influence aesthetic rating. Nevertheless, this objectivist approach fails to explain the idiosyncratic nature of aesthetic experiences (AE). Recent models propose a multi-process account of AE, integrating a subjective evaluation based on self-referential processing. This proposition seems coherent with neuroimaging studies showing activation of a common neural network during AE and self-reference. Nevertheless, behavioural data supporting this hypothesis is missing. We took advantage of the self-reference effect (SRE) in memory ‚Äì the mnemonic advantage for material encoded in a self-related mode - to test the hypothesis that aesthetic judgement is based on self-related processes. We predicted that if aesthetic judgement recruits self-referential processing, incidentally encoding artworks in this condition should produce a similar mnemonic advantage as the SRE. To test this hypothesis, 30 participants incidentally encoded 60 painting in three conditions: self-reference, judgement of beauty and judgement of symmetry (control condition). We found that items encoded in the aesthetic judgment condition were as well recognized as those encoded in self-reference condition when participants gave extreme judgements on the beauty scale during encoding. These findings suggest that at least intense AEs activate an individual‚Äôs sense of self.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Preprint - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: Evidence from a common mnemonic advantage between aesthetics judgement and self-reference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["R","Statistics"],"content":"\rIntroduction\rMany psychology fields require to extract individual scores, i.e., point-estimates (i.e., a single value) for a participant/patient, to be used as an index of something and later interpreted or re-used in further statistical analyses. This single index is often derived from several ‚Äútrials‚Äù. For instance, the reaction times in the condition A (let‚Äôs say, the baseline) will be averaged together, and the same will be done with the condition B. Finally, the difference between these two means will be used an the individual score for a given participant.\nHowever, we can intuitively feel that we lose a lot of information when averaging these scores. Do we deal appropriately with the variability related to individuals, conditions, or the noise aggravated by potential outliers? This is especially important when working with a limited amount of trials.\nWith the advent of recent computational advances, new easy-to-implement alternatives emerge. For instance, one can ‚Äúmodel‚Äù the effects at an individual level (e.g., the simplest case, for the two conditions paradigm described above, would be a linear regression with the condition as a unique predictor), and use the parameters of each model as individual scores (e.g., the ‚Äúslope‚Äù coefficient of the effect of the manipulation), rather than the raw mean. This opens up the possibility of including covariates and take into account other sources of known variability, which could lead to better estimates.\nHowever, individual models are also sensitive to outliers and noise. Thus, another possibility is to model the effects at the population level and, at the same time, at the individual level. This can be achieved by modelling the participants as a random factor in a mixed model. In this case, the individual estimates might benefit from the population estimates. In other words, the effects at the population level will ‚Äúconstrain‚Äù or ‚Äúguide‚Äù the estimation at an individual level to potentially limit extreme parameters.\nUnfortunately, the above method requires to have all the data at hand, to be able to fit the population model. This is often not the case in on-going acquisition, or in neuropsychological contexts, in which the practitioners simply acquire data for one patient, and have to compute individual scores, without having access to the detailed population data. Thus, an in-between alternative could make use of Bayesian models, in which the population effects (for instance, the mean effect of the condition) could be entered as an informative prior in the individual models to, again, ‚Äúguide‚Äù the estimation at an individual level and hopefully limit the impact of noise or outliers observations.\nIn this post, the aim is to compare these 4 methods (basic individual model - equivalent to using the raw mean, population model, individual model with informative priors) in recovering the ‚Äútrue‚Äù effects using a simulated dataset.\n\rResults\rGenerate Data\rWe generate several datasets in which we manipulate the number of participants, in which the score of interest is the effect of a manipulation as compared to a baseline condition. 20 trials per condition will be generated with a known ‚Äútrue‚Äù effect (the centre of the distribution from which the data is generated). Gaussian noise of varying standard deviation will be added to create a natural variability (See the functions‚Äô definition below).\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(easystats)\rdata \u0026lt;- get_data(n_participants=1000, n_trials=20)\rresults \u0026lt;- get_results(data)\r\rFigure 1: Example of a dataset containing 20 participants (shown with different colors). As can be seen, we introduced modulations in the inter- and intra- individual variability.\r\rWe will then compare the scores obtained by each method to the ‚Äútrue‚Äù score of each participant by substracting them from one another. As such, for each method, we obtain the absolute ‚Äúdistance‚Äù from the true score.\n\rFit model\rContrast analysis will be applied to compare the different methods together.\nmodel \u0026lt;- lm(Diff_Abs ~ Method, data=results)\rmodelbased::estimate_contrasts(model) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(Difference) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(Level1 = stringr::str_remove(Level1, \u0026quot;Diff_\u0026quot;),\rLevel2 = stringr::str_remove(Level2, \u0026quot;Diff_\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% select(Level1, Level2, Difference, CI_low, CI_high, p)\r## Level1 Level2 Difference CI_low\r## 1 IndividualModel_Priors PopulationModel -0.001846824 -0.011537451\r## 2 IndividualModel_Freq PopulationModel 0.001704568 -0.007986059\r## 3 IndividualModel_Freq IndividualModel_Priors 0.003551392 -0.006139235\r## CI_high p\r## 1 0.007843802 1\r## 2 0.011395194 1\r## 3 0.013242019 1\r\rVisualize the results\r\rFigure 2: Average accuracy of the different methods (the closest to 0 the better).\r\r\rFigure 3: Accuracy depending on the number of total participants in the dataset.\r\r\r\rConclusion\rThough not significantly different, it seems that raw basic estimates (that rely only on the individual data) perform consistently worse than the population model or individual models informed by priors, especially for small datasets (between 10 and 100 participants) - though again, the difference is tiny in our simulated dataset. In the absence of the whole population dataset, it seems that using individual Bayesian model with informative priors (derived from the population model) is a safe alternative.\n\rFunctions\rlibrary(tidyverse)\rlibrary(easystats)\rlibrary(rstanarm)\rlibrary(ggdist)\r# Get data ----------------------------------------------------------------\rget_data \u0026lt;- function(n_participants = 10, n_trials = 20, d = 1.5, var = 3, noise = 0.1) {\rscores_baseline \u0026lt;- rnorm(n_participants, 0, 1)\rscores_condition \u0026lt;- rnorm(n_participants, d, 1)\rvariances \u0026lt;- rbeta(n_participants, 2, 8)\rvariances \u0026lt;- 0.1 + variances * (var / max(variances)) # Rescale\rnoise_sd \u0026lt;- abs(rnorm(n_participants, 0, noise))\rdata \u0026lt;- data.frame()\rfor (i in 1:n_participants) {\ra \u0026lt;- rnorm(n_trials, scores_baseline[i], variances[i])\rb \u0026lt;- rnorm(n_trials, scores_condition[i], variances[i])\ra \u0026lt;- a + rnorm(n_trials, 0, noise_sd[i]) # Add noise\rb \u0026lt;- b + rnorm(n_trials, 0, noise_sd[i]) # Add noise\rdata \u0026lt;- rbind(data, data.frame(\r\u0026quot;Participant\u0026quot;

Pick one young and brilliant neuropsychologist and ask \u0026ldquo;what is neuropsychology?\u0026quot;. In some cases, after a few seconds of hesitation, you could hear answers like \u0026ldquo;being a neuropsychologist means doing this or that\u0026quot;. In other cases, you might come across incomplete - or even false - responses, such as \u0026ldquo;neuropsychology is a tool\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a method\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a paradigm\u0026rdquo;, or even worse, \u0026ldquo;a point of view\u0026rdquo;.\nThat does not mean that our neuropsychologist is incompetent, far from it. But formally defining our field as a whole is not an exercise that we are used to do. Indeed, the training in neuropsychology usually comes in a fragmented way, little by little. A bit of cognitive neuroscience here, a bit of neuropsychological syndromes there, some cognitive tests administration over here, and some cortical neuroanatomy over there\u0026hellip; Though we might, in fine, acquire a global vision and understanding of neuropsychology, verbalizing it is seldom necessary.\nThe definition of neuropsychology is actually quite complex to formalize, and can even be hotly debated. The jobs and positions that stem out of this field are many, and practitioners often tend to circumscribe neuropsychology to their own activity. For instance, a neuropsychologist that mainly does cognitive rehabilitation with psychiatric patients might have quite a different vision from another that does, day after day, presurgical cognitive assessments. And that is without mentioning the neuropsychologists pursuing an academic career, or even the ones that have moved to the private sector.\nNo problem, would argue the careful reader, if the definitions are too narrow, let\u0026rsquo;s take more general one. It\u0026rsquo;s not that simple. Indeed, neuropsychology occupies a very particular place in the network of science, as it is at the crossroads between social sciences, biological sciences and medical fields. Giving a definition that is too large would lose its essence in the nebulous depths of neuroscience and psychology, which would be not be accurate; neuropsychologists, whether they are clinical practitioners or not, have a common training, a specific theoretical grounding, as well as a unique interpretation and analysis framework underpinned by a scientifically rigorous method. Taking these elements into account, I will attempt to give a simple, comprehensive and informative definition of neuropsychology.\nThe first axiom that we need to discuss is the notion of science. Is neuropsychology its \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; scientific field, or is it a mere portion of another one, such as cognitive neuroscience or psychology, which differs from other specializations only through its object of interest? \u0026ldquo;By science\u0026rdquo;, says Schopenhauer in his PhD thesis with a baroque title (On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason), \u0026ldquo;we understand a system of notions, i.e. a totality of connected, as opposed to a mere aggregate of disconnected, notions.\u0026quot; This definition applies well to neuropsychology, that contains a set of theories, hypotheses, methods and proofs feeding from one another and creating a coherent ensemble. As such, neuropsychology is its own scientific discipline, although a singular one\u0026hellip;\nIndeed, what is the \u0026ldquo;bigger\u0026rdquo; box in which neuropsychology fits? While neuropsychologists are often initially trained in psychology, one could argue that the focus on the brain makes it more belonging to neuroscience. Well, the organization and structure of Science is a complicated issue. However, the particularity of the topographical location of neuropsychology is quite apparent.\nOn the one hand, neuropsychology belongs to a cluster of sciences interested a specific biological organ: the brain. As such, neuropsychology is an integral part of neuroscience. On the other hand, neuropsychology is interested in the productions of the brain (e.g., thoughts, feelings and behaviours) with a focus on the cognitive level (analyzing things in terms of cognitive processes and mechanisms), which makes it also belonging to psychology. Moreover, one could argue that neuropsychology, through its integration of the study of what we are biologically, and who we are mentally, has been connected to, and used as evidence in, philosophy of mind debates (for instance, famous neuropsychological cases studied by Sacks, Ramachandran or Milner have been widely discussed by contemporary philosophers). Finally, contrary to many other domains, neuropsychology has also an applied, practical component, that can be used in clinical practice. This clinical aspect, registering neuropsychology withing medical fields, takes multiple forms, such as assessment, diagnostic or therapeutic care, and can be used with a wide variety of patients and illnesses. These multiple facets make the wealth of neuropsychology, which offers an exceptional freedom of practice.\nAs we have seen, neuropsychology is located at the centre of colliding galaxies of knowledge, such as neuroscience, psychology, medicine and philosophy. However, the fast development of neuropsychology is gradually leading to the creation of subcomponents within itself, corresponding to different practices and theoretical steps. And these clusters are themselves growing. For instance, clinical neuropsychology was historically focused on diagnostic cognitive assessments, but has recently expanded on the treatment-side of things, with innovations like cognitive training and rehabilitation. This underlines neuropsychology as a rapidly evolving field, moving its potential towards yet uncharted territories.\nThe fourfold structure of neuropsychology Neuropsychology is born from the convergence of cognitive neurology, with pioneers such as Broca and Wernicke (which made inferences about brain functioning based on the observations of patients with brain lesions) and psychologists such as Ribot (focusing on the organization and semiology of cognitive deficits). This history has shaped neuropsychology as a two-faced entity, with one experimental side dedicated to understand the relationship between brain and cognition (by using pathological cases or natural variability of neurocognitive characteristics), and one clinical aspect, focusing on bringing this knowledge to the benefit of the patients suffering from brain disorders.\nHowever, beyond these two pillars of neuropsychology, recent advances have outlined a more theoretical level of neuropsychology, dedicated to a high-level integration of the data at hand to elaborate general theories and interfacing them with evolutionary or philosophical principles. Similarly, a computational facet, referring to the operationalization of the functioning in statistical terms, starts to emerge as a pseudo-independent aspect, propelled by the regain of interest and focus on the methodological and statistical aspects of psychology and neuroscience.\nThis structure is not fixed, but driven by the evolution of the field. It is possible that new poles will emerge, or differentiate over time, until maybe they separate from - or create new clusters within - neuropsychology.\n The fourfold structure of neuropsychology.  The definition of neuropsychology Neuropsychology is a theoretical and practical science investigating the relationship between 1) the structure and functioning of the brain, and 2) cognitive processes and their related derivatives, such as thoughts, feelings and behaviours. It is organised in four interconnected and overlapping dimensions:\n Experimental neuropsychology studies the variability of the brain and cognition (whether from pathological origin or not) to test theories and models through empirical experimentation. Clinical neuropsychology uses theories and models about mental functioning to better detect and assess disorders and deficits, leading to a precise diagnostic and an adapted treatment. Computational neuropsychology transforms the data acquired through experiments and observation into logical or statistical models of mental functioning that are used to operationalize the processes at stake. Theoretical neuropsychology integrates the evidence to elaborate and develop unifying theories to address fundamental questions about mental functioning.  Neuropsychology is located at the crossroads between neuroscience and psychology, at the interface between theory and practice. Its practitioners, the neuropsychologists, are bound by a specific training, by unique theoretical and historical references, and are endowed with an analysis and interpretation framework backed by a rigorous and scientific investigation methodology.\nThanks for reading!

This article is not an advertisement for it, but rather a perspective on the role of technical social networks in psychology.   I already mentioned in another post that technical aspects and skills will play an increasing role in psychology. This relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t by any means new. More than a century ago, pioneering psychologists were demonstrating formidable engineering and craftsmanship skills to build new tools and apparatuses to measure what they were interested in (see for instance Nicolas \u0026amp; Makowski, 2016). But years have gone by, and the digital revolution has happened. As a result, most of the \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; aspects (a rather vague term covering everything that is not related to the semantic knowledge of psychological theories and facts) are now ultimately tied to software. Critically, your ability to use these softwares will determine the speed and ease at which you can achieve your goals and produce high quality assignments.\nAs an example, during my studies, most of the statistics course was delivered through the usage of one particular software (Statistica¬© ü§Æ). At the exam, your score didn\u0026rsquo;t much depend on your understanding of what a t-test is, when to use it or anything like that; but rather on your knowledge of the software, and your ability to click on the right buttons faster than your peers. While this is an unfortunate example that can be used to criticize the reliance on tools rather than fundamental knowledge, it also tells us something about the reality of the current world. In research, the better you are for instance at data processing (which involves both the knowledge of how to navigate the software and the knowledge of what to do in general), the faster you will be able to carry it out, and the less stressed you will be, resulting in a cascade of other positive outcomes (increased well-being, work-quality, productivity, opportunities, etc.).\nHowever, one common mistake is to delay learning new stuff (especially things outside our comfort zone) until we have no choice. This is understandable given that in the short term, certain skills may not be absolutely needed (i.e., you can manage without them) and acquiring them can be a steep learning curve (which can be hard, frustrating and effortful). However, you should start investing in your technical skills as soon as possible (as the time devoted to learning will only shrink as you advance) if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to become very close friends with pressure, stress, hatred, frustration and despair. So stay on the light side of the force and embrace the future.\n\rA psychology researcher realizing that he should have learned programming earlier.\r\rAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just about learning to use some software just for the sake of having things done and getting faster results. A lot of science is done through software, not only with them. People are actively discussing new methods, algorithms and tools that then expand like never before the possibilities of researchers. Flaming debates have been going on with frameworks and workflows clashing with thunderous sparks (for instance, Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics, ANOVAs vs. (mixed) regressions, etc.), and these calls for change find echo because of developments of software, allowing initiated users to test, validate and use new methods.\nOpen-access software It might not seem like it when you\u0026rsquo;re studying it at the university, but science is currently in the middle of a revolution. A massive paradigmatic change, partly fuelled by the growth of open-science, which covers aspects like open-access and open-source. This means, for software, that they are no longer being developed by private companies and sold for money. Instead, they are developed in a public fashion, and everybody is welcome to chime in and provide input, suggestions, report bugs or improve the code.\nOpen-source development means faster and better software, and more importantly, the creation of a true connection between developers and users. In fact, the former are often first and foremost also the latter, meaning that in a lot of cases (at least, mine üòÖ), people started writing a software because they needed it for their own personal job.\nBut the beauty lies in the fact that users can seemingly become developers too, or contributors, at the very least. Sometimes, users end up on a software development page to solve a bug or an issue that they encountered. From there, there can start following the developments, and getting involved. And not necessarily be writing code. It can be by answering to other issues, helping other users, reporting bugs and typos, improving the documentation, giving ideas and suggestions, testing new features and encouraging the developers. There are so many to contribute to the development and, as a result, become an active member of the open-science community. And moreover, doing so is also a great way to learn the theoretical bits. For instance, the most efficient way of learning the complexities of EEG acquisition and processing was to follow the development of an EEG-processing software (namely, MNE-Python). Reading issues that users encountered, and replies from experts and developers, trying to understand what functions do, what are the different parameters, what are the possibilities, the limits and so on.\nAll in all, engaging in open-source software is a great way to increase your technical expertise and get involved in the community of researchers. And who knows, you might meet cool people, create new connections, and that\u0026rsquo;s always great!\n\rHelp making the world like the first pane.\r\rSoftware as a social network Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve buckled up, ready to engage in open-source software, you might wonder; where does that happen? Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce GitHub.\nSeveral years ago, when I was an undergrad student, I had to write a lot of stuff, such as for instance reports, project and theses. All of these documents went through several back and forths with supervisors, which made comments and modifications. But I was terribly afraid to remove some paragraph or sentence that I would need later on. As a result, I ended up in a hell in which my tormentors were named project.docx, project_v2.docx, project_v3.docx, project_v3_modifs.docx, project_v3_final.docx, project_v4_comments.docx, project_v4_final.docx, project_v4final2.docx, project_v4_finalfinal.docx. And what if my computer broke (that was before Dropbox)? I could lose everything üò±\nThis is when I heard about something called version control. Apparently, there was a system out there that allowed you to save all your modifications, and be able to go back at any point in time. This system was called git, and it was super obscure. However, I discovered that this system had a, online interface, in the form of a website, on which you can go and upload files and documents for free. This is how I discovered GitHub. And back in the days, it was really mostly used by programmers (because the nature of code makes it very suited for version control), a world I didn\u0026rsquo;t belong to.\n There several great alternatives go GitHub, like GitLab, BitBucket, etc., that might be just as good, if not better. The reason why I\u0026rsquo;m mainly talking about GitHub here is because this post is not about the intrinsic quality or features of these platforms for developers, but rather as a social network. An important part of any social network is its popularity and, - as of for now - GitHub is the most popular.   I witnessed GitHub growing and becoming a true social network, improving its accessibility and user-friendliness. It is now more like a hub where all kinds of people gather to discuss software and technical bits, than a den for hairy geeks. There are also many users who are new to programming (e.g. researchers who are using software as a means to an end) and if you belong to this category of people, don\u0026rsquo;t underestimate your contribution to developers! Often it is such users that help developers improve user friendliness and identify code bugs (for example, when running the code on actual data sets). It is also used as a public technical portfolio, in which you can display your achievements, your projects and your interests. And while it was originally centred around programming, it has extended its audience quite a bit, and people are now using GitHub to store data (for instance the COVID-19 data), books, create websites (for instance, this website is stored on GitHub) or write scientific papers!\nThe reason why I\u0026rsquo;m writing this is because I know all too many young researchers, grappling with some software, struggling to find help, that are too shy to just contact the developers or the community. Just jump in there, create a public issue (instead of writing an email, so that your question will benefit future users). Most of the developers will be happy to help, and glad to see their software and code actually used by others.\nIn conclusion, go and dive into the world of open-science and open-source software, you\u0026rsquo;ll be on the right side of history. üòé\nWhat to do once you\u0026rsquo;re on GitHub At the very least, the very first step is to create an account. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t use it now, it will be useful in the future (it shows that you are interested in technical stuff, it allows you to post issues and connect to other platforms, and support developers).\n Find a package / software that you like. Super biased suggestions include:   NeuroKit: a Python package for Neurophysiological Signal Processing  bayestestR: an R package for Bayesian statistics  correlation: an R package for correlations  report: an R package to report statistics  effectsize: an R package for effect sizes  parameters: an R package for understanding statistical models  performance: an R package for testing how good your model is   \u0026ldquo;Watch it\u0026rdquo; (the button in the top-right corner), so you\u0026rsquo;ll be notified of its activity Read the README file (the \u0026ldquo;front page\u0026rdquo;), check-out the issues, understand how to navigate the repository Engage with the developers, create an issue to report bugs or problems, or just to express support - developing a software takes time and effort, and is often done out of passion and for free.

Mind wandering corresponds to a shift of attention toward task-unrelated thoughts. Few studies, however, have tested this link between memory encoding and mind wandering. The goal of the present work was to systematically investigate the influence of mind wandering during encoding on episodic memory performances in an ecological setting. Fifty-two participants were asked to navigate in a virtual urban environment. During the walk, they encountered different scenes that, unbeknownst to the participants, were target items presented in a subsequent recognition task associated with a Remember‚ÄìKnow‚ÄìGuess paradigm. Each item triggered, after a random interval, a thought probe assessing current mind wandering. We found a significant linear positive relationship between the ratio of correctly recognized items and the overall mind wandering reported after the task. Moreover, we found a quadratic reversed U-shaped relationship between the probability of giving a ‚ÄòRemember‚Äô response and both on-line and mind wandering reported a posteriori. The nearer to the medium value the level of mind wandering was, the higher was the probability to have a recollection-based recognition. Our results indicate that in a complex environment, the highest probability of actually remembering a scene would be when participants present a medium attentional level: neither distracted by inner thoughts nor too focused on the environment. This open attentional state would allow a better global processing of the environment by preventing one‚Äôs attention from being captured by internal thoughts or narrowed by an over-focusing on the environment.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2020 - In Medio Stat Virtus: intermediate levels of mind wandering improve episodic memory encoding in a virtual environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski"],"categories":["R","Python","Psychology"],"content":"Many psychology students or researchers are faced with the challenge - or the opportunity - of learning a programming language. Which one should you learn?\nAs an ex- psych student and a daily user and developer of both, here\u0026rsquo;s my take on this hot debate.\nWhat has programming to do with psychology? If you\u0026rsquo;re a very young psychology student, or a future one, you might wonder: why the heck would I have to learn programming in psychology? \u0026ldquo;Psychology is like philosophy, it\u0026rsquo;s just learning how people\u0026rsquo;s minds work by reading books and overthinking stuff\u0026rdquo;. If you still think that, you\u0026rsquo;re in for one hell of a ride.\nPsychology is, since its very beginning, a hard and experimental science. The founding fathers of psychology were dedicated to find ways to objectively measure psychological phenomena and uncovering the mathematical laws that govern Human behaviour (one of the fields of psychology is even called psychophysics). This sciency nature has been toned down by the booming popularity of pseudo-scientific approaches like psychoanalysis, that contributed to the stereotypical public image of the shrink doodling while listening to a neurotic patient. But that\u0026rsquo;s a distorted and old-fashioned view, clearly not representative of the future of psychology.\nThe fact is that psychology is very closely connected with statistics. Many great statistical advances were made by psychologists, and all true psychological discoveries are backed by statistical findings. And this importance of statistics is - and will be - growing further, partly due to the recent realization of some major issues in the field due to improper statistical procedures (coined the \u0026ldquo; replicability crisis\u0026quot;). Moreover, psychology is more and more relying on advanced data-acquiring methods (smartphone apps, website data, physiological and brain recording devices like EEG, MRI, etc.). And these new formats often require specialized knowledge (web-scraping, database querying, neuroimaging, signal processing, machine learning, \u0026hellip;). Even in the most applied kind of clinical or psychotherapeutic specialization, where you\u0026rsquo;d think you\u0026rsquo;d be safe, they are starting to use data intensive methods like neuro-feedback, virtual reality or smartphone sensing and surveying.\nLong story short, no matter which branch of psychology you specialize in, you will be confronted with some technical aspects that won\u0026rsquo;t be able to solve with Excel. Importantly, these are the skills that will make the most difference between students, and that will matter a lot if you want to pursue research.\nSo, ready to dive into programming? Fear not! It\u0026rsquo;s not that complicated. Moreover, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most rewarding skill you can develop. I can assure you that you won\u0026rsquo;t regret the time invested in learning it üòä\nBut where should you start?\nBoth R and Python This increasing relationship between psychology and statistics on the one hand, and other more general technical aspects on the other, is the reason why R and Python are so popular in psychology. Both languages are free, open-source, suited for beginners, and have a large base of users with a ton of learning material online. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between them?\nPut simply, R is for statistics, Python is for the rest.\nSo why is there a virulent debate going on, and a choice to make? It\u0026rsquo;s true that I, in theory, would recommend learning both, as they are complementary and have their own strengths and weaknesses.\nHowever, many opinionated people arguing in favour of one or the other (usually the only one they know) will say that learning both is essentially a waste of time. They will put forth a strong argument: you can do whatever you do in R in Python, and vice-versa. In other words, both languages can be used to achieve your goals, and it\u0026rsquo;s better to specialize in one than have a limited knowledge of both.\nAlthough I do not agree with that statement, I do acknowledge that people have limited time and resources to learn. Saying \u0026ldquo;just learn both\u0026rdquo; is easy, but is arguably an unrealistic expectation for the vast majority of people. So why learning both can be a long-term goal (especially if you want to do research), you have to start somewhere. So, what starter language should you select?\n\rAsh choosing his starter programming language. He has the choice between R, Python and Bulbasaur, i.e, Matlab - the one that no one likes.\r\rWhat about Matlab? There was a time when Matlab was the boss. It was used everywhere and had the best functionalities for neuroimaging, signal processing and maths. But that time is over. Matlab is already a dead language, which burial process will continue in the years to come. Why is it dead? Because it is expensive, closed, ugly, and most importantly the alternatives (namely R and Python) are now more powerful and featured than Matlab.\n\rAgamemnon reacting to king Priam saying \"The city of Matlab will never be conquered\".\r\rThe truth is, there are only two reasons people still use Matlab: habit (it\u0026rsquo;s hard to learn a new approach if your old way of doing things still works) and SPM (a toolbox for neuroimaging that is still - for now - the leader in the field).\nBut seriously, don\u0026rsquo;t waste time on it if you have limited resources, it\u0026rsquo;s just not worth it. You will learn an outdated tool that you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use in another lab if they don\u0026rsquo;t agree to pay for an expensive license (unless you\u0026rsquo;re a pirate ‚ò†Ô∏è). Whereas with open and free languages like R or Python, you have access to the best tools and can use them freely everywhere. Also, it makes you a supporter of open-science, and that\u0026rsquo;s trendy üòÅ.\nHow to decide between R and Python Time has come to make a decision.\nDespite what people say, R and Python are not equivalent. You can argue as much as you want, but doing statistics and data visualization in Python is not as fast, easy and neat as it is in R. And signal processing or neuroimaging is not as powerful in R as compared to Python. Note that both languages are still growing and changing, and they are influencing themselves: for instance, many popular Python modules (e.g., pandas, statsmodels, seaborn, \u0026hellip;) have been directly inspired by R. As such, the boundaries between the two languages are fading (and I\u0026rsquo;m not even mentioning the great advances in interoperability, with tools like reticulate that allow you to use one language directly inside the other).\nThat being said, Python and R remain very different languages at their core, with a different feel and vibe to it. R was made by statisticians for statistics, and the majority of its users are academics and researchers. On the contrary, Python is a true general-purpose \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; language, widely used outside of academia, in the private sector.\nHere are some things to consider when deciding on what language to learn:\nReasons to choose Python  You have some basic knowledge or familiarity with programming  For instance, you know what a loop is. Python being a true programming language, having any prior experience will be useful.\n You are good with logic and spatial representation (like imagining shapes in 3D, rotating them, etc.)  In Python, you will have to think with a \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; mindset. That means perceiving things in terms of logical statements and blocks, understanding data as 2D or 3D tables that you have to slice and recombine.\n You are comfortable with maths  In Python, numbers and numbers combinations are used a lot. Paradoxically, you will typically see a lot more of maths in Python than in R.\n You plan to do signal processing or experimental tasks creation  These are some of the domains where Python is well-established (which doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that R doesn\u0026rsquo;t have some great tools in development).\n You are good at googling and don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending time looking for the right answer  Python has so much material online that it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes hard to find the appropriate thing. Harder than in R, in my opinion.\nReasons to choose R  You have no experience with programming whatsoever  R is not made to be used as a traditional programming language. It\u0026rsquo;s more of finding what functions to apply to what, and that makes it easy for beginners.\n You are interested in statistical analyses, modelling things, and making inferences from data  R excels at this. You can create powerful models super easily and jump into their understanding and interpretation.\n You like making nice figures and plots  R, through the ggplot ecosystem, has hands down the best tools for visualization. Your imagination is the limit (check-out the artworks by Thomas Lin Pedersen abd Danielle Navarro üòç).\n You are not so good with stats or maths  You heard it right! To start with R you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know stats or maths like a boss. R, in fact, will help you to become proficient at it, by slowly opening more and more layers of complexity to you, if you are deemed worthy.\n You are interested in joining the academic community  Because most of its users are academics, R has a fantastic community online, for instance on Twitter #rstats.\nOther considerations  What your peers are learning  It\u0026rsquo;s easier to learn together, so try to discuss it with your class or lab mates if you can.\n What your lab is using  It might be easier if you have mentors that can understand what you are doing and guide you. But that should not be a priority, as it can lead to old habits reproduction (especially if your lab has a tradition of Matlab ü§≠).\nHands on! üëâ Looking for places to start?

We can also specify the average heart rate, although note that there will be some natural variability (which is a good thing, because it makes it realistic).\nimport neurokit2 as nk # Load the package simulated_ecg = nk.ecg_simulate(duration=8, sampling_rate=200, heart_rate=80) nk.signal_plot(simulated_ecg, sampling_rate=200) # Visualize the signal The simulation is based on the ECGSYN algorithm (McSharry et al., 2003).\nHowever, for fast and stable results (as the realistic algorithm naturally generates some variability), one can approximate the QRS complex by a Daubechies wavelet. An ECG based on this method can also be obtained in NeuroKit by changing the method as follows:\nsimulated_ecg = nk.ecg_simulate(duration=8, sampling_rate=200, method=\u0026#34;daubechies\u0026#34;) nk.signal_plot(simulated_ecg, sampling_rate=200) While faster and stable, the generated ECG is far from being realistic.\nüëâ Discover more about NeuroKit here üëà\nHave fun!\nReferences McSharry, P.

The recovery and execution of these actions require attentional resources. Mindfulness, as a state or a dispositional trait, has been associated with better attentional abilities while mind wandering is linked with attentional failures. In this study, we investigated the impact of mindfulness on PM. Eighty participants learned 15 cue-action associations. They were, then, asked to recall the actions at certain moments (time-based items) or places (event-based items) during a walk in a virtual town. Before the PM task, participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness or mind wandering (control condition) session. Dispositional mindfulness was measured via the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Although considered as two opposite states, we did not report any difference between the two groups on PM abilities. Nevertheless, the natural tendency to describe one's own sensations (the Describing facet of the FFMQ) predicted time-based performance in both groups. We discuss different hypotheses to explain this finding in light of recent findings on the impact of mind wandering on future oriented cognition. Our main observation is a positive link between the Describing facet and time-based PM performances. We propose that this link could be due to the common association of this mindfulness facets and PM with attentional and interoceptive abilities. Additional studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2020 - The impact of state and dispositional mindfulness on prospective memory: A virtual reality study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Tam Pham","Zen J.

Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2020 - The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"I work on reality bending and the core structure of the Self.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Mattan S.

Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - Indices of Effect Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Samantha Lavall√©e","Serge Nicolas","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"7bddf1e59eb757c5ccdb63992e2a5a34","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2019adaptation/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2019adaptation/","section":"publication","summary":"Emotion regulation (ER) plays an important role in psychological well-being.

We administered to a large sample (1226 participants) a brief (12 items) French version of the ASQ. We tested convergent validity by investigating its links with mindfulness trait and life satisfaction. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we tested whether ER features could predict the presence of self-reported mood disorders. We demonstrated a good convergent validity by reproducing the original factor structure. We also showed that the adjusting dimension, referring to the ability to flexibly modulate our emotional experience according to contextual demands, was associated with concurrent markers of psychological well-being such as dispositional mindfulness and life satisfaction. Moreover, this strategy was also related to a low probability of subjectively reporting suffering from a mood disorder. Our results highlighted adjusting as an adaptive ER strategy.

Adopting the Bayesian framework is more of a shift in the paradigm than a change in the methodology; all the common statistical procedures (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, etc.) can also be achieved within the Bayesian framework. One of the core difference is that in the frequentist view, the effects are fixed (but unknown) and data are random. On the other hand, instead of having single estimates of the ‚Äútrue effect‚Äù, the Bayesian inference process computes the probability of different effects given the observed data, resulting in a distribution of possible values for the parameters, called the posterior distribution. The bayestestR package provides tools to describe these posterior distributions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - bayestestR: Describing effects and their uncertainty, existence and significance within the Bayesian framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel L√ºdecke","Philip D Waggoner","Dominique Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"204cdc4b73895ef0339ec96a1cc03a53","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/ludecke2019insight/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ludecke2019insight/","section":"publication","summary":"When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics.

A prominent communication channel between bodily signals and brain structures is provided by baroreceptors. Their phasic activity associated with the cardiac phase has been shown to modulate cognitive control in socio‚Äêemotional contexts. However, whether this effect is specific to the affective dimension or impacts general cognitive control processes remains controversial. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of cardiac phase on different facets of cognitive control. We built a nonemotional cognitive control task to delineate mechanisms such as processing speed, response selection, response inhibition, and conflict monitoring. We showed that the systole (after the blood is ejected from the heart), compared to the diastole, was related to faster responses. Moreover, the cardiac phase dynamics also impacted response inhibition, with an increased probability of failure toward the middle of the course of systole. Although the reported effects were small in terms of magnitude, they highlight the influence of bodily states on abstract cognitive processes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - The heart of cognitive control: Cardiac phase modulates processing speed and inhibition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

In particular, it is not clear whether mindfulness is associated with a diminished emotional response, or with faster recovery. We presented participants with target pictures embedded in a rapid visual presentation stream. The targets could be preceded by negative, neutral or scrambled critical distractors. We showed that dispositional mindfulness, in particular the Non-reacting facet, was related to faster disengagement of attention from emotional stimuli.

Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance.

To date, the impact of the engagement of these sub-systems during encoding on item and relational context binding has not been investigated. Here, we developed a new task combining the Attentional Network Test and an incidental episodic memory encoding task to study this issue. We reported that when the alerting network was not solicited, resolving conflict hindered item encoding. Moreover, resolving conflict, independently of the cueing condition, had a negative impact on context binding.

Unfortunately, a longer life not always corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, aging is associated with growing risk factors for illness associated with societal conditions (isolation, maltreatment), and neurodegenerative diseases. Even normal aging is associated with a cognitive decline that can hinder independence and quality of life of elderly. Thus, one major societal challenge is to build policies that support people of all ages to maintain a maximum health and functional capacity throughout their lives. Meditation could be a promising intervention in contrasting the negative effects of aging. Indeed, it has been shown to enhance cognitive efficiency in several domains, such as attention and executive functions in young adults. Nevertheless, whether these effects extend to old participants is still a matter of debate. Few studies have directly investigated this issue, reporting encouraging results in a large panel of cognitive functions, such as: attention, executive functions and memory. However, a final conclusion about the causal role of meditation and the generalization of these results is made difficult due to several methodological limitations. We propose a roadmap for future studies to pass these limitations with the hope that the present work would contribute to the development of the young research field of meditation in gerontology.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - Meditation and successful aging: can meditative practices counteract age-related cognitive decline?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","L√©o Dutriaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"0e34ee5121ab490679b7bf5aa06d2522","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2017neuropsydia/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2017neuropsydia/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuropsychology encompasses two intimately related aspects: experimental research and clinical activity. Yet, the gap between these two facets has been severely increasing over the last decades due to the developpement of new technological ressources employed in research paradigms, often lacking portability to clinical practice. This gap restrains direct results application and generalization from research to clinical practice, and vice versa. Neuropsydia. py is a Python module that provides a high-level set of tools to quickly and easily create computerized experiments, cognitive tests or questionnaires, offering the possibility to heighten up the quality and accuracy of clinical neuropsychology. This free, open-source solution allows neuropsychologists, psychologists and neuroscientists to build sophisticated tasks and focus on what is important: the results and their interpretation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - Neuropsydia. py: A Python Module for Creating Experiments, Tasks and Questionnaires","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Margherita Arcangeli","Prany Wantzen","Tiziana Zalla","Stephane Lemaire","Jerome Dokic","Jerome Pelletier","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"42c876946832642a35d0a80fe18964ed","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2017distinctive/","section":"publication","summary":"Several theoretical models stress the role of executive functions in emotion regulation (ER). However, most of the previous studies on ER employed explicit regulatory strategies that could have engaged executive functions, beyond regulatory processes per se. Recently, there has been renewed interest in implicit forms of ER, believed to be closer to daily-life requirements. While various studies have shown that implicit and explicit ER engage partially overlapping neurocognitive processes, the contribution of different executive functions in implicit ER has not been investigated. In the present study, we presented participants with negatively valenced pictures of varying emotional intensity preceded by short texts describing them as either fictional or real. This manipulation was meant to induce a spontaneous emotional down-regulation. We recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) and subjective reports of emotion arousal. Executive functions (updating, switching, and inhibition) were also assessed. No difference was found between the fictional and real condition on EDA. A diminished self-reported arousal was observed, however, when pictures were described as fictional for high- and mild-intensity material, but not for neutral material. The amount of down-regulation in the fictional condition was found to be predicted by interindividual variability in updating performances, but not by the other measures of executive functions, suggesting its implication even in implicit forms of ER. The relationship between down-regulation and updating was significant only for high-intensity material. We discuss the role of updating in relation to the consciousness of one's emotional state.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - The distinctive role of executive functions in implicit emotion regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Serge Nicolas","Dominique Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"dcb1984190a3b354ffc9604a87f27044","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/nicolas2016can/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nicolas2016can/","section":"publication","summary":"In 1834, the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878) measured for the first time the tactile discrimination threshold with a compass.

The few neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have evidenced that midline cortical structures and lateral fronto-parietal regions are more engaged for real and fictional entities, respectively. Interestingly, the former network is engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference, processes that are known to boost emotional reactivity, while the latter underpins emotion regulation. Thus, a possible modulation of the emotional response according to the nature (real or fictional) of the stimulus is conceivable. To test this hypothesis, we presented short emotional (negative and positive) and neutral video as fictional or real. For negative material, we found that subjective emotional experience, but not physiological arousal measured by electrodermal activity, was reduced in the fictional condition. Moreover, the amount of personal memories linked to the scenes counteracted this effect boosting the subjective emotional response. On the contrary, personal memories elicited by the scenes, but not fiction, modulate the emotional response for positive material. These results suggest that when a stimulus triggers a personal memory, the emotional response is less prone to be modulated by contextual factors, and suggest that personal engagement could be responsible for emotional reaction toward fiction. We discuss these results in the emotion regulation framework and underline their implications in informing theoretical accounts of emotion in the neuroscientific domain and the philosophical debate on the paradox of emotional response to fiction.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The paradox of fiction: Emotional response toward fiction and the modulatory role of self-relevance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"68110a20505a874a1b7dc092abec0f6b","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/sperduti2016protective/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2016protective/","section":"publication","summary":"Life expectancy is constantly increasing. However, a longer life not always corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, even normal aging is associated with a decline in different cognitive functions. It has been proposed that a central mechanism that could contribute to this widespread cognitive decline is an ineffective inhibitory attentional control. Meditation, to the other hand, has been associated, in young adults, to enhancement of several attentional processes. Nevertheless, attention is not a unitary construct. An influent model proposed the distinction of three subsystems: the alerting (the ability to reach and maintain a vigilance state), the orienting (the capacity of focusing attention on a subset of stimuli), and the conflict resolution or executive component (the ability to resolve conflict or allocate limited resources between competing stimuli). Here, we investigated, employing the Attentional Network Task (ANT), the specific impact of age on these three subcomponents, and the protective role of long-term meditation testing a group of older adults na√Øve to meditation, a group of age-matched adults with long-term practice of meditation, and a group of young adults with no previous meditation experience. We reported a specific decline of the efficiency of the executive component in elderly that was not observed in age-matched meditators. Our results are encouraging for the investigation of the potential beneficial impact of meditation on other cognitive processes that decline in aging such as memory. Moreover, they could inform geriatric healthcare prevention and intervention strategies, proposing a new approach for cognitive remediation in elderly populations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The protective role of long-term meditation on the decline of the executive component of attention in aging: a preliminary cross-sectional study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Sophie Blanchet","Serge Nicolas","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"0e9e4df520f3d07f067b6015556bf791","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2015emotion/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2015emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"Aging is usually associated with cognitive decline, specifically of the executive functions supported by the frontal lobe. However, in line with observations about the preservation or even the increase of well-being with age, it has been suggested that emotion regulation efficiency follows the same developmental trajectory, remaining stable over time, or even increasing. Emotion regulation refers to a family of strategies aiming at modifying the nature, the intensity, the duration or the expression of emotions. These various strategies rely on different neurocognitive processes in order to be efficient. As these processes are differently affected by aging, some of those strategies appear more affected than others. Thus, elderly people tend to use more frequently situation selection strategies, such as avoiding potentially negative situations, while their ability to regulate an emotion using cognitive reappraisal (ie, changing the meaning of the situation), a strategy drawing heavily on executive resources, appears less efficient than in younger people.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2015 -
