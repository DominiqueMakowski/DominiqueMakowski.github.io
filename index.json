The recovery and execution of these actions require attentional resources. Mindfulness, as a state or a dispositional trait, has been associated with better attentional abilities while mind wandering is linked with attentional failures. In this study, we investigated the impact of mindfulness on PM. Eighty participants learned 15 cue-action associations. They were, then, asked to recall the actions at certain moments (time-based items) or places (event-based items) during a walk in a virtual town. Before the PM task, participants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness or mind wandering (control condition) session. Dispositional mindfulness was measured via the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Although considered as two opposite states, we did not report any difference between the two groups on PM abilities. Nevertheless, the natural tendency to describe one's own sensations (the Describing facet of the FFMQ) predicted time-based performance in both groups. We discuss different hypotheses to explain this finding in light of recent findings on the impact of mind wandering on future oriented cognition. Our main observation is a positive link between the Describing facet and time-based PM performances. We propose that this link could be due to the common association of this mindfulness facets and PM with attentional and interoceptive abilities. Additional studies are needed to explore this hypothesis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2020 - The impact of state and dispositional mindfulness on prospective memory: A virtual reality study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Tam Pham","Zen J.

Critically, and despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by developing and validating a short and reliable 16-item questionnaire to characterize the lying pattern of individuals. Our findings suggest the existence of four distinct latent dimensions to lying, namely frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We establish the convergent validity of our measure of lying by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduces a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait which future deception studies can build on, accounting for the inter-individual variability in lying.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2020 - The Structure of Deception: Validation of the Lying Profile Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Mattan S.

Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - Indices of Effect Existence and Significance in the Bayesian Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti,","Samantha Lavall√©e,","Serge Nicolas,","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"7bddf1e59eb757c5ccdb63992e2a5a34","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2019adaptation/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2019adaptation/","section":"publication","summary":"Emotion regulation (ER) plays an important role in psychological well-being. Therefore, its valid assessment is a crucial step in the investigation of the interindividual differences linked to effective ER. Adapting and validating a French version of the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and test its predictive power in detecting mood disorders. We administered to a large sample (1226 participants) a brief (12 items) French version of the ASQ. We tested convergent validity by investigating its links with mindfulness trait and life satisfaction. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we tested whether ER features could predict the presence of self-reported mood disorders. We demonstrated a good convergent validity by reproducing the original factor structure. We also showed that the adjusting dimension, referring to the ability to flexibly modulate our emotional experience according to contextual demands, was associated with concurrent markers of psychological well-being such as dispositional mindfulness and life satisfaction. Moreover, this strategy was also related to a low probability of subjectively reporting suffering from a mood disorder. Our results highlighted adjusting as an adaptive ER strategy. Practical implications for psychotherapeutic approaches of mood disorders are discussed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - Adaptation and Validation of a Short French Version of the Affective Style Questionnaire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Mattan Ben-Shachar","Daniel L√ºdecke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"7eed62c06518acf02e7c18933a5d3963","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2019bayestestr/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2019bayestestr/","section":"publication","summary":"The Bayesian framework for statistics is quickly gaining in popularity among scientists, for reasons such as reliability and accuracy (particularly in noisy data and small samples), the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge into the analysis, and the intuitive interpretation of results (Andrews \u0026 Baguley, 2013; Etz \u0026 Vandekerckhove, 2016; Kruschke, 2010; Kruschke, Aguinis, \u0026 Joo, 2012; Wagenmakers et al., 2017). Adopting the Bayesian framework is more of a shift in the paradigm than a change in the methodology; all the common statistical procedures (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regressions, etc.) can also be achieved within the Bayesian framework. One of the core difference is that in the frequentist view, the effects are fixed (but unknown) and data are random. On the other hand, instead of having single estimates of the ‚Äútrue effect‚Äù, the Bayesian inference process computes the probability of different effects given the observed data, resulting in a distribution of possible values for the parameters, called the posterior distribution. The bayestestR package provides tools to describe these posterior distributions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - bayestestR: Describing effects and their uncertainty, existence and significance within the Bayesian framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel L√ºdecke","Philip D Waggoner","Dominique Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"204cdc4b73895ef0339ec96a1cc03a53","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/ludecke2019insight/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ludecke2019insight/","section":"publication","summary":"When fitting any statistical model, there are many useful pieces of information that are simultaneously calculated and stored beyond coefficient estimates and general model fit statistics.

A prominent communication channel between bodily signals and brain structures is provided by baroreceptors. Their phasic activity associated with the cardiac phase has been shown to modulate cognitive control in socio‚Äêemotional contexts. However, whether this effect is specific to the affective dimension or impacts general cognitive control processes remains controversial. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of cardiac phase on different facets of cognitive control. We built a nonemotional cognitive control task to delineate mechanisms such as processing speed, response selection, response inhibition, and conflict monitoring. We showed that the systole (after the blood is ejected from the heart), compared to the diastole, was related to faster responses. Moreover, the cardiac phase dynamics also impacted response inhibition, with an increased probability of failure toward the middle of the course of systole. Although the reported effects were small in terms of magnitude, they highlight the influence of bodily states on abstract cognitive processes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2019 - The heart of cognitive control: Cardiac phase modulates processing speed and inhibition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Mindfulness is defined as a present moment non-judgemental attentional stance that can be cultivated by meditation practices, but that may present interindividual variability in the general population. The mechanisms underlying modification in emotional reactivity linked to mindfulness are still a matter of debate. In particular, it is not clear whether mindfulness is associated with a diminished emotional response, or with faster recovery. We presented participants with target pictures embedded in a rapid visual presentation stream. The targets could be preceded by negative, neutral or scrambled critical distractors. We showed that dispositional mindfulness, in particular the Non-reacting facet, was related to faster disengagement of attention from emotional stimuli.

Neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have reported the involvement of brain structures related to self-relevance and emotion regulation, suggesting a threefold interaction between the appraisal of reality, aspects of the Self, and emotions. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of implicit fictional reappraisal on different components of emotion, as well as on the modulatory role of autobiographical and conceptual self-relevance. While recording electrodermal, cardiac, and brain activity (EEG), we presented negative and neutral pictures to 33 participants, describing them as either real or fictional. After each stimulus, the participants reported their subjective emotional experience, self-relevance of the stimuli, as well as their agreement with their description. Using the Bayesian mixed-modeling framework, we showed that stimuli presented as fictional, compared with real, were subjectively appraised as less intense and less negative, and elicited lower skin conductance response, stronger heart-rate deceleration, and lower late positive potential amplitudes. Finally, these phenomenal and physiological changes did, to a moderate extent, rely on variations of specific aspects of self-relevance.

Several studies have shown that manipulation of attention during encoding can impact subsequent memory performance. An influential model of attention distinguishes between three partially independent attentional networks: the alerting, the orienting and the executive or conflict resolution component. To date, the impact of the engagement of these sub-systems during encoding on item and relational context binding has not been investigated. Here, we developed a new task combining the Attentional Network Test and an incidental episodic memory encoding task to study this issue.

Moreover, resolving conflict, independently of the cueing condition, had a negative impact on context binding.

Unfortunately, a longer life not always corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, aging is associated with growing risk factors for illness associated with societal conditions (isolation, maltreatment), and neurodegenerative diseases. Even normal aging is associated with a cognitive decline that can hinder independence and quality of life of elderly. Thus, one major societal challenge is to build policies that support people of all ages to maintain a maximum health and functional capacity throughout their lives. Meditation could be a promising intervention in contrasting the negative effects of aging. Indeed, it has been shown to enhance cognitive efficiency in several domains, such as attention and executive functions in young adults. Nevertheless, whether these effects extend to old participants is still a matter of debate. Few studies have directly investigated this issue, reporting encouraging results in a large panel of cognitive functions, such as: attention, executive functions and memory. However, a final conclusion about the causal role of meditation and the generalization of these results is made difficult due to several methodological limitations. We propose a roadmap for future studies to pass these limitations with the hope that the present work would contribute to the development of the young research field of meditation in gerontology.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - Meditation and successful aging: can meditative practices counteract age-related cognitive decline?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","L√©o Dutriaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"0e34ee5121ab490679b7bf5aa06d2522","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2017neuropsydia/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2017neuropsydia/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuropsychology encompasses two intimately related aspects: experimental research and clinical activity.

However, most of the previous studies on ER employed explicit regulatory strategies that could have engaged executive functions, beyond regulatory processes per se. Recently, there has been renewed interest in implicit forms of ER, believed to be closer to daily-life requirements. While various studies have shown that implicit and explicit ER engage partially overlapping neurocognitive processes, the contribution of different executive functions in implicit ER has not been investigated. In the present study, we presented participants with negatively valenced pictures of varying emotional intensity preceded by short texts describing them as either fictional or real. This manipulation was meant to induce a spontaneous emotional down-regulation. We recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) and subjective reports of emotion arousal. Executive functions (updating, switching, and inhibition) were also assessed. No difference was found between the fictional and real condition on EDA. A diminished self-reported arousal was observed, however, when pictures were described as fictional for high- and mild-intensity material, but not for neutral material. The amount of down-regulation in the fictional condition was found to be predicted by interindividual variability in updating performances, but not by the other measures of executive functions, suggesting its implication even in implicit forms of ER. The relationship between down-regulation and updating was significant only for high-intensity material. We discuss the role of updating in relation to the consciousness of one's emotional state.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2017 - The distinctive role of executive functions in implicit emotion regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Serge Nicolas","Dominique Makowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"dcb1984190a3b354ffc9604a87f27044","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/nicolas2016can/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nicolas2016can/","section":"publication","summary":"In 1834, the German physiologist Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878) measured for the first time the tactile discrimination threshold with a compass.

The few neuroscientific studies investigating the distinction between the processing of real and fictional entities have evidenced that midline cortical structures and lateral fronto-parietal regions are more engaged for real and fictional entities, respectively. Interestingly, the former network is engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval and self-reference, processes that are known to boost emotional reactivity, while the latter underpins emotion regulation. Thus, a possible modulation of the emotional response according to the nature (real or fictional) of the stimulus is conceivable. To test this hypothesis, we presented short emotional (negative and positive) and neutral video as fictional or real. For negative material, we found that subjective emotional experience, but not physiological arousal measured by electrodermal activity, was reduced in the fictional condition. Moreover, the amount of personal memories linked to the scenes counteracted this effect boosting the subjective emotional response. On the contrary, personal memories elicited by the scenes, but not fiction, modulate the emotional response for positive material. These results suggest that when a stimulus triggers a personal memory, the emotional response is less prone to be modulated by contextual factors, and suggest that personal engagement could be responsible for emotional reaction toward fiction. We discuss these results in the emotion regulation framework and underline their implications in informing theoretical accounts of emotion in the neuroscientific domain and the philosophical debate on the paradox of emotional response to fiction.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The paradox of fiction: Emotional response toward fiction and the modulatory role of self-relevance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Sperduti","Dominique Makowski","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"68110a20505a874a1b7dc092abec0f6b","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/sperduti2016protective/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sperduti2016protective/","section":"publication","summary":"Life expectancy is constantly increasing. However, a longer life not always corresponds to a healthier life. Indeed, even normal aging is associated with a decline in different cognitive functions. It has been proposed that a central mechanism that could contribute to this widespread cognitive decline is an ineffective inhibitory attentional control. Meditation, to the other hand, has been associated, in young adults, to enhancement of several attentional processes. Nevertheless, attention is not a unitary construct. An influent model proposed the distinction of three subsystems: the alerting (the ability to reach and maintain a vigilance state), the orienting (the capacity of focusing attention on a subset of stimuli), and the conflict resolution or executive component (the ability to resolve conflict or allocate limited resources between competing stimuli). Here, we investigated, employing the Attentional Network Task (ANT), the specific impact of age on these three subcomponents, and the protective role of long-term meditation testing a group of older adults na√Øve to meditation, a group of age-matched adults with long-term practice of meditation, and a group of young adults with no previous meditation experience. We reported a specific decline of the efficiency of the executive component in elderly that was not observed in age-matched meditators. Our results are encouraging for the investigation of the potential beneficial impact of meditation on other cognitive processes that decline in aging such as memory. Moreover, they could inform geriatric healthcare prevention and intervention strategies, proposing a new approach for cognitive remediation in elderly populations.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2016 - The protective role of long-term meditation on the decline of the executive component of attention in aging: a preliminary cross-sectional study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Makowski","Marco Sperduti","Sophie Blanchet","Serge Nicolas","Pascale Piolino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"0e9e4df520f3d07f067b6015556bf791","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/publication/makowski2015emotion/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/makowski2015emotion/","section":"publication","summary":"Aging is usually associated with cognitive decline, specifically of the executive functions supported by the frontal lobe. However, in line with observations about the preservation or even the increase of well-being with age, it has been suggested that emotion regulation efficiency follows the same developmental trajectory, remaining stable over time, or even increasing. Emotion regulation refers to a family of strategies aiming at modifying the nature, the intensity, the duration or the expression of emotions. These various strategies rely on different neurocognitive processes in order to be efficient. As these processes are differently affected by aging, some of those strategies appear more affected than others. Thus, elderly people tend to use more frequently situation selection strategies, such as avoiding potentially negative situations, while their ability to regulate an emotion using cognitive reappraisal (ie, changing the meaning of the situation), a strategy drawing heavily on executive resources, appears less efficient than in younger people.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"2015 - Emotion regulation and the cognitive decline in aging: beyond the paradox","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9a71cca745ec70e27cd86aff678e9a08","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/cognitivecontrol/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cognitivecontrol/","section":"project","summary":"A neuropsychological task measuring different aspects of cognitive control (processing speed, inhibition, conflict resolution...)","tags":["Python","Neuropsychology"],"title":"Cognitive Control","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f66be18173afe3a01308b7b76a636350","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/easystats/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/easystats/","section":"project","summary":"A collection of R packages to make the usage statistics and the implementation of good practices easy","tags":["R","Statistics"],"title":"easystats","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b1d532d62aa5089478581d97d951945e","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/neurokit/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neurokit/","section":"project","summary":"A Python toolbox for neurophysiological signal processing (EEG, EDA, ECG, EMG...)","tags":["Python"],"title":"NeuroKit","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e6c410317866b17585fe664584bbc08d","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/neuropsydia/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neuropsydia/","section":"project","summary":"A Python module for creating experiments, tasks and questionnaires","tags":["Python","Neuropsychology"],"title":"Neuropsydia","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ebcf8ceac7154932f8e0c243aa360c8c","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/patientassessmentapp/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/patientassessmentapp/","section":"project","summary":"An web application to facilitate the neuropsychological assessment of patients","tags":["R","Neuropsychology"],"title":"Patient Assessment","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"189a45e7d1934948d6d14b55f5c62da2","permalink":"https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/project/psycho/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/psycho/","section":"project","summary":"An R tooldbox for psychological science","tags":["R"],"title":"psycho","type":"project"}]
