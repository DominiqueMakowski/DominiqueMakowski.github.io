I'm a neuropsychologist, psychotherapist & PhD student, currently living in Paris, France. I'm fluent in French, Polish, English, Python, and somehow good at pretending to speak Italian. My main figures of reference are Epictetus, Churchill and Batman. My interests are as broad as open-science, history of arts and transhumanism. My papers are available on the [research](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/research.html) page üôå
